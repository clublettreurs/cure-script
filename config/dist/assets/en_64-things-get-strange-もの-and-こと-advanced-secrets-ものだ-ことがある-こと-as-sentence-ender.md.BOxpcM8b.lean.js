Mono and Koto: advanced secrets: ものだ, ことがある, こと as sentence-ender | Lesson 64</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about <code>もの</code> and <code>こと</code> in some of their more advanced senses.</p><p>Now, near the beginning of this course we talked about <code>もの</code> and <code>こと</code>, and I said what people usually say, which is that <code>もの</code> is a concrete thing, like a pencil or an apple or a tree, and <code>こと</code> is an abstract thing, like a situation, a circumstance, an action.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, this is broadly true and it&#39;s certainly the best way to grasp it in the beginning, but then we come across some other situations which don&#39;t seem to fit in with that.</p><p>One of my Patrons wrote to discuss the sentence: <code>愛はすばらしいいもの</code>, which means <code>Love is a wonderful thing</code>.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, surely love is abstract. You can&#39;t put it in a box and carry it from Kyoto to Tokyo. So what&#39;s going on here?</p><p>My Patron said that she looked it up on various Japanese learning sites and they couldn&#39;t explain it at all. They just said you have to learn which cases you use <code>もの</code> and which cases you use <code>こと</code>.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the case at all. What <code>もの</code> really designates is a <code>thing</code>. And a thing is a noun, so it can be a concrete thing like an apple or a book or a universe, but it can also be an abstract thing like love or happiness. These are all nouns.</p><p>So <code>愛はすばらしいいものど</code> is the only way you can say it, because <code>ai</code> is a <code>もの</code>, not a <code>koto</code>. It&#39;s a noun. It&#39;s a thing. It&#39;s not a state, it&#39;s not an action, it&#39;s not a condition. It&#39;s a thing.</p><p>And we need to bear this in mind as we look at some of the more extended meanings of <code>もの</code> and <code>こと</code>, as we start to see <code>もの</code> and <code>こと</code> on occasion being used as something like sentence enders.</p><p>But before we get to that, let&#39;s look at some of the other extended uses of <code>こと</code>. Now, one of the most common ones is <code>したことがある</code>.<img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>For example, we might say <code>日本に行ったことがある</code>. And that means <code>I have been to Japan</code>.</p><p>And, as you see, <code>I have been to Japan</code> is a different kind of statement from <code>I went to Japan</code>. <code>I went to Japan</code> is referring to one particular instance of going to Japan. <code>I have been to Japan</code> is saying that in the past, perhaps on one occasion, perhaps on many occasions, going to Japan is something that I have done. In Japanese what we&#39;re literally saying is <code>The activity, the fact, of my having been to Japan in the past exists.</code></p><p>Now, I had an Italian Patron at one time who took me up on my early lesson on the Japanese tenses. I said that Japanese has only three tenses. And that&#39;s correct: Japanese has only three tenses. And my Italian friend asked me &quot;So how would I say something like &#39;I have been to Japan&#39; as opposed to &#39;I went to Japan&#39;?&quot; And I explained how that is. And he said <code>Well, in that case, Japanese doesn&#39;t just have three tenses. It&#39;s just like Italian or French or other European languages...</code> It has perfective tenses and pluperfect and all these complicated things that European languages have.</p><p>And therefore I should be teaching it that way. I should be teaching the Japanese past and present and future and pluperfect and perfective and all that sort of thing.</p><p>But that is a perfect example of what&#39;s wrong with Western Japanese teaching. It would be bundling Japanese, categorizing Japanese as if it were a European language gone wrong. Of course any language of any sophistication needs to be able to express just about any kind of time relation.</p><p>But it doesn&#39;t do it in the way that European languages do it. It doesn&#39;t do it by means of conjugating verbs. In fact, as I&#39;ve said before, Japanese doesn&#39;t conjugate verbs at all, even in cases that look a bit more like it to Western eyes.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>It uses an entirely different kind of strategy. It says <code>The fact of my having been to Japan exists</code>.</p><p>Now, if we go from <code>したことがある</code> to the present tense, <code>することがある</code>, if instead of saying <code>日本に行ったことが ある</code>, we say <code>日本に行くことがある</code>, we&#39;re now saying <code>The fact of my going to Japan exists</code>.</p><p>In other words, we&#39;re saying <code>I sometimes go to Japan / going to Japan is a fact that exists</code>. If we say <code>どんな人にも失敗することがある</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>everybody sometimes makes mistakes / whatever kind of person it may be, the fact of making mistakes exists</code>.</p><p>Now, if you&#39;re going to start calling these things tenses, that would have to be the past-present-and-future-occasionally-happening tense, which is nonsense, but then so&#39;s all the rest of it.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>It&#39;s simply the Japanese strategy for saying that a certain category of event sometimes happens–the fact of its happening exists.</p><p>Now, <code>もの</code> is sometimes used in ways that really do seem like a sentence-ender. And the first way in which this happens is when we add <code>mono だ</code> to a complete logical clause.</p><p>And what this means is that the logical clause we&#39;re talking about, as a generalization, is a reality–it&#39;s a <code>もの</code>, it&#39;s a thing, it&#39;s something we have to contend with, it&#39;s something we have to accept.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>And this is why we&#39;re using <code>もの</code> here and not <code>こと</code>. When we say <code>ことがある</code>, we&#39;re literally talking about a <code>こと</code>, a state of affairs, a fact that happens, but here we&#39;re consolidating what we&#39;re talking about into a <code>thing</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s not literally a thing, it&#39;s not literally something you could hold in your hand, but we are using the hyperbole of saying that it is.</p><p>If we say <code>冬は寒いものだ</code>, what we&#39;re saying is &quot;winter is cold, and that&#39;s just a thing, that&#39;s a thing, you have to come to terms with it&quot;.</p><p>Someone says <code>Ooh, it&#39;s cold</code> and you say <code>冬は寒いものだ</code> — <code>winter IS cold / winter&#39;s a cold thing</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, we can actually parse it out in that way. We can make it <code>冬は寒い</code> is a complete sentence but we could also be saying <code>冬は寒いものだ</code> - <code>winter is a cold thing</code>, and this would be a complete logical sentence. Whether it&#39;s intended in that way or not is not always possible to tell, and it doesn&#39;t tend to matter because the meaning is much the same either way.</p><p>But there are sentences when it can&#39;t possibly be read as simply grammatical. So, for example, we may say <code>希望のあるところには必ず試練があるものだ</code>, and what we&#39;re saying there is <code>Where there&#39;s hope, there&#39;s always a test</code>, a test here meaning something we have to overcome, something we have to do in order to attain that hope.</p><p>Now, there&#39;s no way of tying this up logically. We simply have the complete logical sentence <code>希望のあるところには必ず試練がある</code> and then we&#39;re adding to the end of it, as a kind of sentence-ender, <code>ものだ</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>It doesn&#39;t make logical sense, but what you&#39;re doing is making that statement and then emphasizing it and also putting a particular kind of stress on it by saying <code>ものだ</code> – <code>that&#39;s just how it is, it&#39;s a thing, that&#39;s something we have to understand, that&#39;s something we have to get used to, it&#39;s something that doesn&#39;t change, it&#39;s something that&#39;s inevitable</code>: <code>ものだ</code> – <code>it&#39;s a thing</code>.</p><p>Now, interestingly, that&#39;s when we have <code>ものだ</code> in the present; when we put it in the past it has a different implication. And again, this isn&#39;t some strange rule we have to learn.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="">Just as with <code>することがある</code> versus <code>したことがある</code>, there are perfectly good reasons why it has to be like that. The <code>ものだ</code> we&#39;ve just discussed has to be in the present tense because we&#39;re talking about generalization, and the present tense, as we know, isn&#39;t really a present tense.</p><p>It covers the present and the future, and it can, even though it&#39;s called the non-past tense<img src="'+r+'" alt=""> — it&#39;s really the indefinite tense – it can cover the past as well so long as it&#39;s also covering the present and the future. So it&#39;s a generalization tense in this case. But when we say it in the past it has a different meaning.</p><p>If we say <code>子供のころには、よくこちらに来たものだ</code>, what we&#39;re saying is <code>When I was a child I often used to come to this place.</code></p><h2 id="ものだ-here-is-referring-to-something-in-the-past" tabindex="-1"><code>ものだ</code> here is referring to something in the past. <a class="header-anchor" href="#ものだ-here-is-referring-to-something-in-the-past" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;code&gt;ものだ&lt;/code&gt; here is referring to something in the past.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>And what it&#39;s saying is that in the past it was a thing. And it has a kind of personal implication. <code>It&#39;s a thing, it&#39;s a thing I think about, it&#39;s a thing I remember / to me, those past memories are a thing, they&#39;re a reality.</code></p><p>So again, we&#39;re using this <code>もの</code> for something which is essentially abstract.</p><p>What&#39;s the difference between saying <code>東京に行ったものだ</code> and <code>東京に行ったことがある</code>?</p><p>The <code>ことがある</code> is simply a literal statement: <code>The fact of my having been to Tokyo exists.</code></p><p><code>東京に行ったものだ</code> is in English like saying <code>I used to go to Tokyo</code> and it has much more emotional weight. It&#39;s like saying <code>This is a thing I used to do, this is something that used to happen</code>.</p><p>And you see we concretize it by figuratively calling it <code>a thing</code>: it was a <code>もの</code>, it was a thing, it was something that used to happen.</p><p>Now, I&#39;m not going to go into sentences that top off a logical clause with <code>ということ</code> or <code>というもの</code>, because that would take us into the extended meanings of <code>という</code> and the quotation function, which is a whole other area.</p><p>But I am going to talk briefly about a place where we see <code>こと</code> used on its own as something like a sentence-ender.</p><p>We see a logical clause followed by <code>こと</code>. And people sometimes say that this marks an order, but that&#39;s not exactly correct.</p><p>What it marks is a rule or a regulation. And that&#39;s an important distinction. You&#39;ll see why in a minute.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>So, if you&#39;re going to a dojo and see a list of rules pinned to the wall, it may be numbered and it may say <code>一何々こと, 二何々こと, 三何々こと</code>, and that&#39;s really like saying <code>Rule 1: 何々, Rule 2: 何々</code>, etc.</p><p>You might go into one of those Penguin Cafés where the waiters and waitresses are all penguins and you may see a sign saying <code>ペンギンをくすぐらないこと</code> and that means <code>Don&#39;t tickle the penguins</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p>And the reason it&#39;s marked with <code>こと</code> is because this is a rule of the establishment. If you go into that café, you are duty bound not to tickle the penguins, ever, however tempting it may be, because it&#39;s a <code>こと</code>.</p><p>And what is a <code>こと</code>? In this case it&#39;s a decision which also means a rule or a regulation.</p><p>I&#39;ve made a video before about the expressions <code>ことになる</code> and <code>ことにする</code>. When you put <code>ことにする</code> at the end of a logical clause, we&#39;re saying that one has <code>decided to do</code> the action of that logical clause.</p><p>When we have <code>ことになる</code>, it means that the action of that logical clause has been decided upon. And we have to put that passively in English, because there&#39;s no other way of translating it into English, but it&#39;s not passive in Japanese.</p><p>As we know, Japanese has no passive. So, this is the same <code>こと</code> — <code>a decided thing</code>.</p><p>And in Japanese, this also implies a rule or a regulation. One of the commonest words for a rule or regulation in Japanese is a <code>決まり</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>決まり</code> is the i-stem, the noun-form of the verb <code>決まる</code>. And <code>決まる</code> is the self-move version of the pair <code>決める / 決まる</code>.</p><p><code>決める</code> means to <code>decide something</code> and <code>決まる</code> means <code>something has been decided</code>. And once again, we&#39;re forced to put it passively in English although it&#39;s not passive in Japanese.</p><p>And I&#39;ve made a video about this whole passivity problem that English has with Japanese. So if you want to pursue that further, I suggest you watch that video.</p><p>So, a <code>こと</code> is the same as a <code>決まり</code>: <code>a decided thing / a rule / a regulation</code>. And when it&#39;s put on to the end of a logical clause, it simply marks that logical clause as a rule or a regulation.</p>',70)]))}const S=g(y,[["render",f]]);export{x as __pageData,S as default};
