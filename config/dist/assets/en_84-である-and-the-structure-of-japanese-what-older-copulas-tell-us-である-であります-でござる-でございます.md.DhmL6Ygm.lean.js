Well, we&#39;ll talk about that in a minute.</p><p><strong><code>ござる</code> is simply made up of the honorific <code>ご</code> plus <code>ざる / 座る</code>,</strong><strong>which originally means <code>seated</code>, but has the extended meaning of <code>existing</code>.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>座る is normally read as すわる, but its On-yomi reading is ざ, therefore ざる here because I guess it is referring to its extended meaning of <code>existing</code>?</p></div><p><strong>So <code>ござる / ご座る</code> is just <code>ある</code> in fancy form.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>You won&#39;t hear <code>でござる</code> very much at all because since it&#39;s an honorific form</strong><strong>these days it&#39;s nearly always used with the <code>ます</code> helper verb attached.</strong></p><p>But you will hear <code>ござる</code> perhaps in period drama and things like that. <strong>It&#39;s samurai talk.</strong></p><h2 id="でございます" tabindex="-1">でございます <a class="header-anchor" href="#でございます" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;でございます&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong><code>でございます</code> is the form of the copula that&#39;s used in keigo,</strong> so <strong>you&#39;ll hear it in shops, you&#39;ll hear it in public announcements</strong>, and you&#39;ll hear it used by speakers in anime etc who are using very honorific speech, perhaps sub-villains talking to the main villain.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>So that&#39;s really all we need to say about those three.</p><h2 id="である" tabindex="-1">である <a class="header-anchor" href="#である" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;である&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>But <code>である</code>, which is the root of all of them, is the one we need to pay attention to.</strong></p><p>You could call it, in a way, <strong>the <code>straight copula</code>.</strong></p><p><strong><code>だ</code> sounds casual, <code>です</code> is polite, but <code>である</code> is just the copula.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>We see it used in contexts where we&#39;re simply being objective,</strong><strong>such as academic papers, newspaper reporting, that kind of thing.</strong><strong>We&#39;ll also see it used in other contexts regardless of</strong><strong>what register the writing is in because it has a particular quality.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>As we know, <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> can only be used at the end of a logical clause.</strong><strong>They are logical-clause endings and they can&#39;t be used to pre-modify a noun.</strong><strong>If we want to pre-modify a noun with another noun marked by the copula,</strong><strong>we can only do that if it&#39;s an adjectival noun, because adjectival nouns</strong><strong>can use the pre-modifying version of the copula, which is <code>な</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>We can say <code>花が<strong>綺麗だ</strong></code> (flower <strong>pretty-is</strong>) or we can say <code><strong>綺麗な</strong>花</code> (<strong>pretty-is</strong> flower).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>And it&#39;s precisely because this group of nouns and I&#39;ve talked about the three groups of special nouns in another video if you&#39;d like to look at that<sup><a href="./41-5-key-facts-about-the-basic-structure-of-japanese">[41]</a></sup><strong>this particular special group of nouns, adjectival nouns, has the property</strong><strong>that it&#39;s able to use the pre-modifying form of the copula, <code>な</code>.</strong></p><p>This is something that the textbooks don&#39;t seem to know. They don&#39;t tell you what <code>な</code> is and they tell you that adjectival nouns are actually some weird thing called <code>な-adjectives</code>. But that&#39;s another matter.</p><p><strong>So what do we do if we want to use a copula-marked noun</strong><strong>as a pre-modifier and it isn&#39;t an adjectival noun?</strong></p><p>Now, we don&#39;t do this an awful lot because we can work around the situation by using <code>の</code>. But in some cases either this doesn&#39;t work or it just isn&#39;t what we want to do.</p><p>So, suppose we want to say <code>Sakura <strong>who is</strong> a university student</code>. Now, we can say <code>大学生<strong>の</strong>さくら</code>, which is <code>the university student Sakura</code>.</p><p>But suppose we don&#39;t want to say that. <strong>Suppose we actually want to say <code>Sakura who is a university student</code>?</strong> <em>(make a relative clause)</em></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>It&#39;s not quite the same, in Japanese or English. <strong>In order to do this we have to use the copula and</strong><strong>we have to use it as a pre-modifier, so we have to use <code>である</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s our only choice. We can&#39;t use <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code></strong><strong>because they can only be used at the end of a logical clause.</strong><strong>And we can&#39;t use <code>な</code> because <code>大学生</code> is not an adjectival noun.</strong></p><hr><p>So we say <code>大学生<strong>である</strong>さくら</code>. <em>(Sakura <strong>who is</strong> a university student)</em></p><p>And you&#39;ll see that sometimes, especially in written material.</p><hr><p><strong>But there are cases where you really don&#39;t have the choice at all.</strong><strong>For example, if you want to say <code>the state of being round</code></strong>, you would say <code>円形<strong>である</strong>さま</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong><code>さま</code> is a state or condition.</strong><strong>We can&#39;t really use の here; <code>円形のさま</code> doesn&#39;t really work.</strong></p><p>So we really have to say <code>円形<strong>である</strong>さま</code>.</p><p>Now, <strong>when I say that <code>である</code> is the straight copula,</strong> not the casual one, not the polite one, just the straightforward copula, there&#39;s another reason for this, <strong>because ultimately and historically <code>だ</code> is simply an abbreviation of <code>である</code></strong><strong>and <code>です</code> is an abbreviation of <code>であります</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>So, if you&#39;ve followed my course, if you&#39;ve been trained up to look at Japanese structurally, there are certain questions that this may make you want to ask, and some people have asked me.</p><p>First of all, haven&#39;t I presented the copula as an indivisible, special unit, one of the three engines, but <strong>here it seems to be made up of two elements,</strong><strong><code>で</code> and <code>ある</code>, and it looks very much like a verb.</strong></p><p>So what&#39;s going on here? And then, <strong>why in any case do the elements <code>で</code> and <code>ある</code></strong><strong>add up to the concept of the copula?</strong></p><h3 id="why-で-ある-add-up-to-make-copula" tabindex="-1">Why で &amp; ある add up to make copula <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-で-ある-add-up-to-make-copula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why で &amp; ある add up to make copula&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, let&#39;s look at this second part first and then we&#39;ll look at the first part.</p><p>Why do <code>で</code> plus <code>ある</code> make the copula concept? <strong>Well, as we know there are two <code>で</code>s in Japanese.</strong><strong>There&#39;s the particle <code>で</code> and then there&#39;s the て-form of the copula.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>The textbooks don&#39;t tell you this. They let you think everything is the particle <code>で</code>.</p><p><strong>But as we know there are two <code>で</code>s.</strong><strong>Now, the one we&#39;re dealing with here is obviously the particle <code>で</code>.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Huh…funny that this で particle thing was also one of my theories about である (and だ)</p></div><p><strong>It can&#39;t be the て-form of the copula because the fundamental copula</strong><strong>can&#39;t be made up of two elements, one of which is already the て-form of itself.</strong></p><p>And in order to understand what&#39;s going on here, why <code>で</code> and <code>ある</code> add up to the copula, we need to know two things.</p><p>Now, I&#39;ve made videos on both of these and I&#39;ll link them as well, but let&#39;s just recap it here.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>it’s a bit hard to say which videos Dolly meant, but if so review Lessons 40, 41, 55 and 79.</p></div><p><strong>The two things we need to know are first of all what the copula actually is,</strong><strong>and the second is what the particle <code>で</code> actually does.</strong></p><h4 id="what-the-copula-actually-is-does" tabindex="-1">What the copula actually is / does <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-the-copula-actually-is-does" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What the copula actually is / does&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>What the copula actually is is something that takes two nouns, A and B,</strong><strong>and tells us that noun A is part of a set represented by noun B.</strong></p><p>That&#39;s what the copula does. <strong>That&#39;s all it does.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p>So if we say <code>さくらが日本人だ</code><strong>we&#39;re saying Sakura (noun A) is part of the set Japanese people (noun B).</strong></p><p><strong>And sometimes the set can be a set of one.</strong> So if we say <code>That person over there <strong>is</strong> Sakura</code>, then we&#39;re saying that <strong>that person over there belongs to the set of one which is Sakura.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re not talking about other Sakuras.</strong><strong>We&#39;re talking about this particular Sakura.</strong></p><hr><h4 id="what-the-particle-で-is-does" tabindex="-1">What the particle で is / does <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-the-particle-で-is-does" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What the particle で is / does&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>So now, what does the particle <code>で</code> actually do?</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve made a video about that and I&#39;ll link it.<sup><a href="./55-secrets-of-the-で-particle-why-do-we-say-みんなで行く-and-世界で一番">[55]</a></sup></p><p><strong>Fundamentally the particle <code>で</code> defines the limit or field or parameter</strong><strong>within which an action takes place or a state of being prevails.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So the simplest use of <code>で</code> is to say where an action takes place:</strong><code><strong>公園で</strong>遊ぶ</code> (play <strong>in the park</strong>) <strong>the park, which is marked by <code>で</code>, is the field, the area, the parameters, within which I play;</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p><code><strong>世界で</strong>一番おいしいラーメン</code> (the most delicious ramen <strong>in the world</strong>) <strong>the world marked by <code>で</code> marks the field, the area within which this ramen is the first, number one.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And it gets extended a bit further in other cases.</strong><strong>It could be the material something&#39;s made with, the tool something is made by, etc.</strong><strong>In all cases it singles out a particular parameter from other parameters</strong><strong>that allow the making to take place.</strong></p><h3 id="back-to-である" tabindex="-1">Back to である <a class="header-anchor" href="#back-to-である" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Back to である&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, when we take <code>である</code>, what this is saying is <strong>exist (ある) within a particular boundary or parameter;</strong> in other words, <strong>exist within a set.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And that&#39;s what the copula tells us.</strong><strong>It tells us what set, what boundary, something exists in.</strong></p><p>Sakura <strong>exists within the boundary of</strong> Japanese people.</p><p>If we say <code>鷲が鳥<strong>だ</strong></code> (an eagle <strong>is</strong> a bird) we&#39;re saying <strong>an eagle exists within the boundary, within the parameter, within the set, <code>birds</code>.</strong></p><p>And this is what the copula always does. <strong>So <code>である</code> is a very precise construction of the copula.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s get to the second question.</p><h4 id="is-である-the-copula-a-verb" tabindex="-1">Is である / the copula a verb? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-である-the-copula-a-verb" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is である / the copula a verb?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The second question is, <strong>does this mean that it isn&#39;t really</strong><strong>an indivisible element of Japanese, one of the three engines?</strong><strong>And does it mean that it&#39;s a verb?</strong></p><p><strong>Because obviously <code>ある</code> is a verb, and it&#39;s because</strong><strong><code>ある</code> is a verb that we can use it as a pre-modifier.</strong></p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p><p>We can say <code>大学生<strong>である</strong>さくら</code> because <strong>you can always use a verb to pre-modify a noun.</strong></p><p>And the answer to the question is that this is a question of modeling.</p><p>I model Japanese in a particular manner. <strong>It is possible to model it in other manners.</strong></p><p><strong>In Japanese grammar as taught to Japanese students, the copula is regarded as a verb.</strong><em>(thus, copula has a verbal function = it can theoretically be regarded as a special kind of verb)</em></p><hr><p>And in fact <strong>an adjectival noun plus the copula is called a <code>形容動詞</code>,</strong><strong>which means an adjectival verb.</strong></p><p><strong>The <code>verb</code> part is the copula which is added to it.</strong></p><p>So <strong><code>綺麗</code> is not a 形容動詞;</strong> <code><strong>綺麗な</strong></code> or <code><strong>綺麗だ</strong></code> <strong>is a 形容動詞</strong>. <strong>And the <code>動詞</code> part, the verb part, is the copula.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>But I do not model the copula as a verb.</strong><strong>And the reason for that is that in our three-engine structure</strong><strong>I restrict the term <code>verb</code> to those entities that end in う-row kana</strong><strong>and do all the things that those entities do: we have the four stems, etc.</strong></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This further shows that there are different ways to view language, and both can work in their own systems, so it is best to be aware of both ways &amp; use them as what works for you.</p></div><p><strong>The copula doesn&#39;t work like this in modern Japanese. It works differently.</strong></p><p><code>である</code> has evolved into an entity in itself with its own て-form, which it has, with its own connective form, <code>な</code>, which it has.</p><p><strong>We could, if we wanted to, model all three engines as verbs,</strong><strong>because in many ways adjectives are also verb-like.</strong><strong>But they don&#39;t work like the う-ending entities and they don&#39;t work like the copula.</strong></p><p>So, within my model of Japanese, which I think is the best one for non-native learners of Japanese to use, we use the three-engine structure.</p><p>We regard verbs, adjectives and the copula as three unique entities.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>This is not a statement about the etymology of Japanese.</strong><strong>It&#39;s not even a statement about the <code>real truth</code> of Japanese grammar,</strong> because there is no <code>real truth</code> in grammar.</p><p><strong>Grammar is simply a means of describing</strong><strong>a pre-existing phenomenon, which is language.</strong></p><p><strong>Grammar is not the source code of language.</strong><strong>Grammar is an attempt to describe language by modeling it.</strong></p><p>And I use and recommend the three-engine model. <strong>If you prefer another model, you&#39;re free to use it.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The other reason I maintain that distinction is because it&#39;s very important</strong><strong>not to confuse <code>で</code> which is the て-form of the copula with the particle <code>で</code>,</strong><strong>and it&#39;s very important not to confuse the concept of the copula</strong><strong>with the verb of being, <code>ある</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt=""></p><p>And that happens all too easily to English speakers or people who are very familiar with English, <strong>because in English the copula and the verb of being</strong><strong>are represented by the same word,</strong><strong>and that&#39;s <code>is</code> and its variants <code>was</code>, <code>am</code>, <code>are</code>, etc.</strong></p><p>They&#39;re the same word, but they&#39;re not the same concept.</p><hr><p><strong>So when we say that <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> mean <code>is</code>,</strong><strong>this is a confusing way of looking at it.</strong><strong>They don&#39;t mean <code>is</code> in all circumstances;</strong><strong>they mean <code>is</code> when it&#39;s the copula.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>That animal <strong>is</strong> a rabbit</code>, this is <strong>the copula</strong>. <strong>We&#39;re placing <code>that animal</code> into the set <code>rabbit</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt=""></p><hr><p>If we say <code>There <strong>is</strong> a rabbit</code>, <strong>that&#39;s not the copula, it&#39;s the verb of being.</strong><strong>We&#39;re saying a rabbit exists, there in that place.</strong></p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, because these two concepts are very easily confusable, and because textbooks and even more advanced academic texts do a very, very poor job of differentiating them, <strong>I believe it&#39;s important to keep the copula, which is</strong><strong>an unfamiliar concept in English, because English has no dedicated copula,</strong><strong>to keep it separate in the three-engine model.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This is quite interesting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS02cADsjfI&amp;lc=Ugwa71x6w5weNeypWEh4AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>link here</strong></a> if the screenshot is too hard to read.
