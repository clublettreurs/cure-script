But then we get expressions which I think most of you will have heard at some time and are perhaps a little more confusing.</p><p>So, <code>夏はアイスクリイムに<strong>限る</strong></code> — now, loosely in English that means <code>In summer, ice cream <strong>is the best thing</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>What we&#39;re actually saying is <code>Speaking of summer, when it comes to summer, it <strong>reaches its limit</strong> at ice cream</code>, in other words, ice cream <strong>is the furthest you can take</strong> summer / ice cream <strong>is the pinnacle of</strong> summer / <strong>there&#39;s nothing beyond</strong> ice cream when we&#39;re talking about summer.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Of course, this is just a natural Eng translation, hence why it is hard to pin-point 限る here.</p></div><hr><p>And this can be used in all kinds of different expressions, for example:</p><p><code>運動なら水泳に<strong>限る</strong></code><br> (if it&#39;s exercise / if we&#39;re talking about exercise, it <strong>reaches its limit</strong> with swimming [<code>水泳</code>] / swimming <strong>is absolutely the best kind of</strong> exercise).</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>And moving on from this we get expressions like <code>彼女に<strong>限って</strong>そんなことはしない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>And again, in loose English this would be &quot;She <strong>of all people</strong> wouldn&#39;t do such a thing / she&#39;d be <strong>the last person</strong> to do such a thing&quot;.</p><p>What we&#39;re actually saying is <code>She is <strong>the very limit of</strong> people who wouldn&#39;t do such a thing</code>.</p><hr><p>So just like ice cream being <strong>the best thing</strong> in summer or calling <strong>at the very maximum extent</strong> of your voice, she is <strong>the maximum, the extreme</strong> of people who wouldn&#39;t do such a thing.</p><p><strong>Other people might possibly do it, even if you&#39;d think they wouldn&#39;t,</strong> <strong>but she is the very limit of the kind of person who wouldn&#39;t do that kind of thing.</strong></p><h2 id="限る-used-negatively-not-limited-to-x" tabindex="-1">限る used negatively (not limited to x) <a class="header-anchor" href="#限る-used-negatively-not-limited-to-x" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;限る used negatively (not limited to x)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>the concept of <code>限る</code> (limit) is often used negatively to show that</strong> <strong>something is not limited to a particular statement, a particular notion.</strong></p><p>So, <code>辞書に書いてあることが常に正しいとは限らない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And this <code>-とは限らない</code> essentially sums up the previous statement</strong> and says that&#39;s <strong>not limited to being the case.</strong></p><p>So what we&#39;re saying here is <code>Things that are written in a dictionary are always correct</code> — <strong>that&#39;s the statement, then we quote that <code>-とは限らない</code>:</strong> <code><strong>It&#39;s not necessarily the case that</strong> things written in a dictionary are always correct.</code></p><p>And I think we found that out to be true on various occasions.</p><h2 id="限り" tabindex="-1">限り <a class="header-anchor" href="#限り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;限り&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, again, this <code>限り</code> can be used for the limits of one&#39;s knowledge and very often is, so <code>私の知っている<strong>限り</strong>ではそんな言葉はない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>So, in English we would say <code>As far as I know, there&#39;s no such word</code>, but the expression strategy here is to modify the noun <code>限り</code> — <code>私の知っている<strong>限り</strong></code> (<strong>the limit of</strong> what I know): <code><strong>Up to the limit of</strong> what I know, there is no such word.</code></p><p>And actually in this case it&#39;s pretty similar to the English: <code><strong>as far as</strong> I know / <strong>to the limit of</strong> what I know</code>.</p><p>And it&#39;s interesting here that <strong>while English says</strong> <code><strong>as far as</strong> I know</code>, <strong>Japanese achieves the same broad pattern by modifying the noun <code>限り</code> (limit).</strong></p><p>And as we talked about last week<sup><a href="./90-japanese-punctuation-how-it-works">[90]</a></sup>, <strong>modification does an awful lot of the heavy lifting in Japanese</strong> <strong>that&#39;s done by other strategies in English.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, another common expression which can be a bit confusing is the kind of expression we find in <code>急いでいる時に<strong>限って</strong>バスが遅れる</code> (<strong>limited to</strong> times when we are in a hurry, the bus comes late).</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>this is obviously not literal, but it expresses a sentiment often felt,</strong> <strong>that the bus or whatever it is that does something we don&#39;t want it to do does it</strong> <strong>specifically when we very much don&#39;t want or can&#39;t afford it to do it.</strong></p><p>So really that expression that can seem a little bit confusing at first is a very natural kind of expression which I think you do find in English sometimes. <strong>It&#39;s only when we really need it that it doesn&#39;t happen.</strong></p><h3 id="その場限り" tabindex="-1">その場限り <a class="header-anchor" href="#その場限り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その場限り&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, another expression is <code>その場限り</code>.</p><p>So, <code>その場限りことを言う</code> means she says things <strong>on the spur of the moment</strong> / she talks right off the top of her head.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><strong><code>その場</code></strong>, which we&#39;ve discussed in another video, which I&#39;ll link<sup><a href="./75-japanese-is-not-english-how-expression-strategies-differ-polite-英本語-rude-japanese">[75]</a></sup>, means literally <strong><code>that place / the appropriate place / the place one would happen to be at at the time</code></strong>, but <strong>of course in Japanese as in other languages, place can also mean a time or an occasion.</strong></p><hr><p>So, <code><strong>その場限り</strong>ことを言う</code> means she says things that <strong>just arise out of the particular occasion and nothing else</strong> — <strong>limited to that particular occasion / having no real relevance outside that particular occasion.</strong></p><p>So the implication is just essentially talking stuff of no real value that comes off the top of her head.</p><h3 id="その場限りさ" tabindex="-1">その場限りさ <a class="header-anchor" href="#その場限りさ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その場限りさ&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And a very common expression related to this is <code>喧嘩はその場限りさ</code> – ケンカ and <strong>this is a popular expression, it&#39;s not exactly a full sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I used Kanji form for ケンカ (喧嘩), but both are fine.</p></div><p><strong>The <code>さ</code> is rather making it into a <code>should</code>.</strong> <strong><code>さ</code> here is saying <code>that&#39;s how it ought to be / come on, that&#39;s how it should be</code>.</strong></p><p>And it&#39;s translated into English as <code>quarrels should not be continued</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s even translated as <code>let not the sun settle on your wrath</code>, which of course is nothing to do with what it&#39;s really saying.</p><p><strong>But the point here is that quarrels should be limited to <code>その場</code></strong> <strong>(the occasion, the event on which they arise).</strong> <strong>So if you quarrel with someone today you shouldn&#39;t be carrying on that quarrel tomorrow.</strong></p><p>Very good advice.</p><p>So this is a range of the circumstances in which the <code>限り / 限る</code> concept is applied in Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>There are others, of course, but with this information I think you&#39;ll be in a better position to see what&#39;s going on.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p><p><img
