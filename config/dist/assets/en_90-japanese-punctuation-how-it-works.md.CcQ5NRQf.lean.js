Lesson 90</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about Japanese punctuation.</p><p><strong>Now, the first thing we need to know about about Japanese punctuation is that most of it is a relatively late arrival in Japanese.</strong> <strong>Most of it came in during the Meiji era, about a hundred and fifty years ago.</strong></p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>This was when Japan was modernizing, and a lot of the reason it came in was to help in translating Western literature.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, <strong>what this means is that in most cases Japanese punctuation doesn&#39;t have such fixed and structural meanings as the equivalent punctuation does in English and other European languages.</strong> So, we need to know what the punctuation is doing and also what it isn&#39;t doing.</p><h2 id="the-full-stop-。" tabindex="-1">The full stop / 。 <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-full-stop-。" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The full stop / 。&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, the first mark we&#39;re going to look at is the Japanese full stop or <code>まる / 。</code>, <strong>which looks like a little circle at the foot of a <code>letter</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>And <strong>this is really the exception to the rule, because it really is structurally clear.</strong> <strong>What it does is end a sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And this is very important for us in understanding how complex Japanese sentences are structured.</strong></p><p>Why is that? Well, <strong>Japanese is a very modification-heavy language.</strong> <strong>That&#39;s to say, a lot of what other languages do by other strategies, Japanese does by modification</strong>, that&#39;s to say, <strong>using clauses to modify nouns or other elements of a sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>Most of the heavy lifting in Japanese structure that&#39;s not done by logical particles is done by this modification structure.</strong></p><p><strong>So whole logical clauses can be used not as logical clauses but in order to modify a noun or some other element.</strong></p><p>So, let&#39;s take a look at how this works.</p><p><code><strong>市場で買って川に落としちゃった</strong>お菓子。</code></p><p>And this means <code>The candy <strong>that I bought at the market and done dropped in the river</strong></code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I guess, done in the translation is used to point out the more literal translation of ちゃった.</p></div><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>the problem with this when we&#39;re reading a complex sentence is that we can get confused about whether something is a logical clause or not.</strong></p><p>So, <strong>are we saying here that I bought something at the market? No, we&#39;re not saying that.</strong> <strong>Are we saying that I dropped something in the river?<br> No, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re saying in this sentence.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Both of those things are just modifying <code>お菓子</code>.</strong> <strong>They&#39;re telling us what kind of an <code>お菓子</code> it was:</strong> <strong>the one I bought at the market and done dropped in the river.</strong></p><p><strong>So all we have here is a single noun, <code>お菓子</code>, that&#39;s been heavily modified by logical clauses that aren&#39;t working as complete logical clauses.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>We can then add a logical particle to that <code>お菓子</code> and make it into a whole logical clause.</strong></p><p>So, we might say, <code>市場で買って川に落としちゃったお菓子<strong>が</strong>魚さんに食べられた。</code></p><p>The candy*(<strong>=subject</strong>)* (I) bought at the market and done dropped in the river got eaten by a fish.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>If I understand correctly, because we marked お菓子 with が subject, we can now build another clause out of it, hence we get another logical clause of <code>お菓子が魚さんに食べられた</code>.</p></div><p><em>While お菓子 is also modified by modifier clauses before it, specifically <code>市場で買って川に落としちゃった</code>, they serve here as simply a modifier that describes お菓子 rather than being complete (standalone?) logical clauses. Although just my guess from how I understand it.</em></p><p><strong>But how do we ensure when we&#39;re reading a sentence like this whether we&#39;re looking at a logical clause or whether we&#39;re looking at a modifier?</strong></p><h2 id="how-to-know-if-it-is-a-logical-clause-or-a-modifier" tabindex="-1">How to know if it is a logical clause or a modifier? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-know-if-it-is-a-logical-clause-or-a-modifier" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to know if it is a logical clause or a modifier?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>the important thing to understand here is that in any kind of Japanese writing</strong><br> (except perhaps on Twitter or something)<br><strong>a logical clause has to end in one of two ways</strong>, <strong>either with a <code>まる / 。</code>, which tells us that it&#39;s the end of the complete sentence</strong></p><p>(it may have a couple of sentence ender particles after it, but it&#39;s a very strict rule of Japanese that <strong>what ends any logical clause is the B-engine, aside from any sentence-ender particles</strong>)</p><hr><p><strong>or it has to end in a clause connector that completes the clause and leads into the next clause.</strong> <strong>This may be the て-form, it may be a word like <code>から</code> or <code>けれど</code>,</strong> but armed with that information we can then see what&#39;s going on.</p><p>So, let&#39;s look at <code>市場で買って川に落としちゃった</code>.</p><p><strong>That&#39;s a complete pair of logical clauses.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>My guess here is that it is theoretically composed of two logical clauses if, like Dolly says below, we presume there is some hidden subject and a hidden direct object if we took both verbs as marking their individual logical clauses - 市場で(私がお菓子を)買った and (私がお菓子を)川に落としちゃった that are then connected using the て-form. Here, お菓子 should be a direct object hence why を, since 落とす and 買う are other-move verbs &amp; require a Subject acting on a Direct Object. Obviously, topic marker can be there too, as 私は in the beginning.</p></div><p><em>But instead, these clauses are combined and since they are followed by a noun serve instead as a modifier for that noun, so therefore they are not logical clauses anymore and do not contain the hidden elements, where instead they are one single big modifier for a noun that is following them, in this case お菓子. It is a shame I cannot ask Dolly about this, as I feel it would help a ton<br> However, I am aware my guess might very likely be wrong, so please take it with a lot of salt.</em></p><p><strong>It&#39;s not telling us what it was that we bought in the market and dropped in the river, but it could perhaps be presuming that.</strong></p><p><strong>But we know that it&#39;s not in fact a logical clause because it doesn&#39;t end in a clause connector and it doesn&#39;t end with a <code>まる / 。</code>.</strong> <strong>It goes straight into a noun.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And this is how we can tell the difference between a modifier and a logical clause.</strong> <strong>And we know when the entire sequence, the entire sentence, is over because it&#39;s going to have that <code>まる / 。</code>.</strong></p><p>And I&#39;ve done a video about this method of analyzing Japanese sentences and I&#39;ll link that so that you can follow it up afterwards<sup><a href="./34-understand-any-sentence">[34]</a></sup>.</p><p><strong>But the <code>まる / 。</code> here is vital.</strong></p><h2 id="the-comma-、" tabindex="-1">The comma / 、 <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-comma-、" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The comma / 、&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the next one we&#39;re going to look at is the Japanese comma, which looks like a little diagonal line at the foot of a letter.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And that&#39;s kind of the opposite of a <code>まる / 。</code>, because it really is not a logical element in the sentence.</strong> <strong>It was adopted into Japanese, but unlike the English comma or other European commas, it has no logical rules.</strong></p><p><strong>Ideas like sectioning off a subordinate clause with commas at each end, that doesn&#39;t exist in Japanese.</strong> <strong>You just put in a comma wherever you want to indicate a pause. And that&#39;s all it does.</strong></p><p>In Japanese schools, students are discouraged from using too many commas, and the reason for this is not incorrect comma usage, <strong>because there is no such thing as incorrect comma usage in Japanese.</strong></p><p><strong>The reason is that commas are not a structural part of Japanese, so students are discouraged from using them as a crutch in conveying their meaning.</strong> <strong>If you can&#39;t convey your meaning without commas, then you&#39;re not writing good Japanese.</strong></p><h2 id="the-question-mark-はてな" tabindex="-1">The question mark / ？(はてな) <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-question-mark-はてな" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The question mark / ？(はてな)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the next one we&#39;ll look at is the question mark or <code>はてな</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>in English the question mark is subject to a rule.</strong> <strong>If you have a question, you have to end it with a question mark.</strong></p><p><strong>And also in English, questions are structurally different from statements.</strong></p><p>So if we say, <code>The coffee is hot</code>, that&#39;s a statement, but if we say, <code>Is the coffee hot?</code> that&#39;s a question.</p><hr><p><strong>In Japanese we don&#39;t have this differentiation.</strong> <strong>Statements and questions are structured exactly the same.</strong></p><p>Now, <strong>in formal Japanese</strong> we have <strong>the question-marking particle <code>か</code></strong>, <strong>which tells us that it&#39;s a question.</strong></p><p>But <strong>in informal Japanese we can use <code>か</code> but mostly we don&#39;t.</strong> <strong>Sometimes we use the question-marker <code>の</code>, but that&#39;s ambiguous because <code>の</code> can also be a statement marker.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The only way you can really tell a question from a statement in Japanese is the rising intonation, which of course you can&#39;t hear in text.</strong></p><p><strong>And so the question mark has become a very useful tool for indicating that rising intonation, for telling us that this is a question, not a statement.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>In English, you have to use the question mark at the end of a question if you&#39;re writing proper English. In Japanese, there&#39;s no such rule.</strong></p><p><strong>If the <code>か</code> marker is there, you don&#39;t use the question mark, but if you want to disambiguate the fact that something is a question rather than a statement, you just pop in a question mark if you want to.</strong></p><h2 id="the-quotation-marks-「-」" tabindex="-1">The quotation marks / 「　」 <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-quotation-marks-「-」" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The quotation marks / 「　」&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The next thing we&#39;ll look at is quotation marks.</p><p><strong>These look like little square brackets at the ends of a statement, and they work exactly the same as English quotation marks.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>They just tell us that something is a quotation: it&#39;s what somebody&#39;s saying.</strong> <strong>We don&#39;t use them for what somebody&#39;s thinking, as we sometimes do in English.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, sometimes you&#39;ll see <strong>double quotation marks</strong> like this, 『　』 <strong>and what they do is mark a quotation that occurs inside another quotation.</strong></p><h2 id="the-side-marks" tabindex="-1">The <code>side-marks</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-side-marks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The &lt;code&gt;side-marks&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the last thing I want to talk about is something that really puzzles people quite a lot.</p><p><strong>In Japanese, particularly Japanese books</strong>, you&#39;ll sometimes see, <strong>especially in vertical text, a set of little marks that look a bit like Japanese commas, running along the left-hand side of a word or a phrase.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>What on earth is this doing?</p><p>Nobody seems to tell you.</p><p><strong>What it is actually doing is either emphasizing that word or phrase or telling us that it&#39;s being used in a special sense.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So what these little marks are really doing is something like putting something into italics in English.</strong></p><p>And I suspect they came into Japanese in the first place to render italicization when translating Western literature.</p><p><strong>There&#39;s no way of really writing Japanese characters in italics.</strong> <strong>There is no italic format for Japanese, so this is what&#39;s used instead.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>This emphasis and the indication that something&#39;s being used in a special sense can also be indicated by katakana, but you will see this from time to time in Japanese texts and that&#39;s what it means.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p><em>Dolly’s link is for Lesson 80.</em></p>',98)]))}const j=d(k,[["render",y]]);export{x as __pageData,j as default};
