These are very small elements, single kana elements of the language, but very vital ones that can, if you don&#39;t know about them, be very confusing because one element can be easily confused with another one that looks identical.</p><p>And the textbooks, in many cases, don&#39;t tell you about this at all. They leave you completely floundering.</p><h2 id="で-connective-て-form-of-the-copula" tabindex="-1">で (connective/て-form of the copula) <a class="header-anchor" href="#で-connective-て-form-of-the-copula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;で (connective/て-form of the copula)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first one we&#39;re going to look at is <code>で</code>. Now, <code>で</code>, as you know, is a logical particle.</p><p>It has a very clearly defined use which we introduced in Lesson 8b. Like all logical particles, it marks a noun, and it tells us that that noun is the place where an action took place or the means by which an action was done.</p><p>However, there is another <code>で</code>, which is not a particle, which is also used very frequently in Japanese, and the textbooks make no attempt to distinguish these two completely different but identical-looking elements. The first time most of us will meet the second of these <code>で</code>s is in the use of adjectival nouns, which are very confusingly and misleadingly called <code>な-adjectives</code> by the textbooks.</p><p>So if we say <code>さくらがきれいで優しい</code>, what we&#39;re saying is that Sakura is pretty and kind. <code>綺麗/きれいだ</code> is an adjectival noun.</p><p>If we want to say <code>The flower is pretty</code>, we say <code>花がきれいだ</code>. And if we want to say <code>the pretty flower</code>, we have to put <code>きれいだ</code> on the other side of the flower, so we say <code>きれいな花</code>.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>And that <code>な</code>, as we know, is the connective form of <code>だ</code>. But if we want to say <code>Sakura is pretty and kind</code>, we can&#39;t use <code>だ</code> and we can&#39;t use <code>な</code>, but we do have to use the copula.</p><p>What we use now is the connective form of the copula, that is to say, its て-form. And the て-form of <code>だ</code> is <code>で</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>to avoid confusion of Dolly using the words ‘the connective form of the copula’ for both な and subsequently で.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p></div><p>So if you say <code>Sakura is beautiful and kind</code>, this is a true adjective, an <code>い-adjective</code>, and we use the て-form to connect it: we say <code>さくらが美しくて優しい.</code> If it&#39;s an adjectival noun, we still have to have the copula, so we say <code>さくらがきれいで...</code></p><p>That&#39;s the て-form of the copula. Now, I&#39;ve already explained that in our lessons on adjectivals, but we also find this <code>で</code>, the て-form of <code>だ</code>, in lots of other cases in Japanese.</p><p>So let&#39;s take a couple of cases and see if you can tell which of the two <code>で</code>s is being used. A very common thing to say to someone when you&#39;re leaving them, perhaps for a while, is <code>お元気で</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>元気</code>, as you know, means <code>well</code> or <code>healthy</code> or <code>lively</code> and the <code>お</code> is just an honorific or prettifier. What is the <code>で</code> here?</p><p>Is it the logical particle or is it the て-form of the copula? This is the て-form of the copula, not the particle.</p><p>The particle doesn&#39;t make any sense here, does it? What&#39;s the て-form of the copula doing?</p><p>Well, we know, don&#39;t we, that the て-form is often used to make an imperative, to tell someone or ask someone to do something. So, if we say <code>待って</code> — <code>wait</code> — this is kind of short for <code>待ってください</code> and we&#39;re asking someone to wait (<code>待って!</code> — <code>Wait!</code>).</p><p>Now, it&#39;s exactly the same with <code>で</code>, which is the て-form of the copula. So, <code>元気だ</code> means <code>is 元気</code>, someone is genki, someone is healthy or lively.</p><p><code>元気で</code> is telling them to *be* genki or lively. <code>お元気で</code> — <code>be healthy / be lively / keep up the good spirits</code>.</p><h3 id="無事-ぶじで" tabindex="-1">無事/ぶじで <a class="header-anchor" href="#無事-ぶじで" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;無事/ぶじで&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Right. So here&#39;s another one: <code>無事でよかった</code> is another very common expression and it means <code>I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re all right / it&#39;s good that you weren&#39;t harmed / it&#39;s good that you&#39;re safe</code> — <code>無事でよかった</code>.</p><p>What do we have here?</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>Once again, we have the て-form of the copula. <code>無事</code>, which means literally <code>no incident</code> and therefore it means <code>nothing happened / nothing bad happened / you weren&#39;t harmed / you&#39;re safe.</code></p><p>So, <code>無事だ</code> means <code>you&#39;re safe / you weren&#39;t harmed / nothing happened</code>. <code>無事で</code> is turning that <code>だ</code>, that copula, into the connective form.</p><p>We use the て-form to connect things, don&#39;t we? So, just as we might say, <code>遅くなってすみません</code> — <code>That I came late, I&#39;m sorry</code> — we also say <code>無事でよかった</code> — <code>That you weren&#39;t hurt, that was good.</code></p><p>And this connective て-form is also used in longer compound sentences. So, for example, we might say <code>さくらはいい子で毎日学校に行く</code> — <code>Sakura is a good child and she goes to school every day.</code></p><p>We have two complete clauses and, just as with the て-form of any verb, we can use it to connect that verb-ending clause to a second clause, so we can do exactly the same thing with the copula. So, <code>さくらがいい子だ</code> — <code>Sakura&#39;s a good girl</code> — is a complete sentence in itself.</p><p>If we want to connect it to a second clause to make it the first half of a compound sentence, we turn that <code>だ</code> into its て-form, <code>で</code>. So, <code>Sakura is a good girl and she goes to school every day.</code></p><p>And as is usual with the て-form connector, it tends to imply a positive relation between the two. It has this implication of <code>Because Sakura&#39;s a good girl, she goes to school every day,</code> but it&#39;s not stating it as strongly as if we&#39;d used <code>から</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, another confusion, which is not kept such a deep, dark secret by the textbooks, but they don&#39;t always stress it clearly enough, and it&#39;s very important because it concerns the very center of the Japanese language, and that is the が-particle.</p><h2 id="が-clause-connector" tabindex="-1">が clause connector <a class="header-anchor" href="#が-clause-connector" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;が clause connector&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The が-particle, as we know, is the one particle that no sentence or clause in Japanese can ever be without, whether we can see it or whether we can&#39;t. <code>が</code> marks the A-car of every sentence, the do-er of an A-does-B clause and the be-er of an A-is-B clause.</p><p>But there is also another <code>が</code>. It&#39;s not easy to confuse the two, provided you&#39;re clearly aware of them.</p><p>The other <code>が</code> is also a clause connector. And usually it&#39;s a contrastive clause connector.</p><p>So, if we say, <code>お店に行ったがパンがなかった,</code> we&#39;re saying <code>I went to the shops, but there wasn&#39;t any bread.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The second が is the particle version of が for its logical clause, marking パン.</p></div><p>So, this is a contrastive conjunction. We went to the shops hoping that there would be bread, but there wasn&#39;t any.</p><p>It&#39;s not possible to confuse this with the other <code>が</code>, the <code>が</code> that marks the subject of the sentence, the A-car, because that <code>が</code>, the particle <code>が</code>, can only ever mark a noun.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>And the clause-connector <code>が</code> can only ever mark a complete sentence. The particle <code>が</code> can&#39;t mark a complete sentence, because a complete sentence can&#39;t end with a noun.</p><p>It has to end with a verb, an adjective, or a copula, as we learned in our very first lesson. So it&#39;s not possible to confuse these two so long as you&#39;re clearly aware of them.</p><p>One more thing that we should note is that <code>が</code> doesn&#39;t have to be contrastive. Most of the time it is, but it can be used as a regular, non-contrastive conjunction.</p><p>It&#39;s worth knowing that, because if you see it connecting two clauses and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any contrast there, you don&#39;t have to rack your brains to find the contrast — occasionally it is used in a non-contrastive manner. And the other thing you need to know is that you will sometimes find this contrastive <code>が</code> at the end of a sentence.</p><p>And I have talked before about sentences that end in a conjunction. Strictly, they&#39;re not complete, because what they&#39;re doing is implying a following clause.</p><p><code>が</code> at the end of a sentence is often a politeness, because <code>が</code> is in fact more polite than <code>けど</code> or <code>でも</code>, the other ways of saying <code>but</code>. So if we said something like <code><em>(私は)</em> コーヒーがほしいが</code> — <code>coffee is want-making (to me)</code> and then we&#39;ve added <code>が</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>And what that <code>が</code> is doing is saying <code>but...</code> and it&#39;s implying a second clause but not stating it, so <code>コーヒーがほしいが</code> means something like &quot;I would like coffee, but... if it&#39;s any trouble please don&#39;t try to get me any coffee&quot; or something along those lines.</p><h2 id="に-that-works-as-と" tabindex="-1">に that works as <code>と</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#に-that-works-as-と" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;に that works as &lt;code&gt;と&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The last one we&#39;re going to consider is less common, but if you&#39;re reading any amount of Japanese you&#39;re going to come across it pretty soon, and that is <code>に</code>. Now, we know <code>に</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s again a logical particle. It&#39;s the targeting particle, and I&#39;ve done a whole video on this because it&#39;s an important and complex particle.</p><p>But there is also another <code>に</code>. And this other <code>に</code>, which is a slightly old usage — it comes from older Japanese — it means the same as <code>と</code>.</p><p>It can be used to and-together two nouns or a list of nouns.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>So in the folk tale Beauty and the Beast, when the father asks one of the less good sisters what she would like him to bring back for her, she says <code>靴に指輪に帽子</code>. She&#39;s saying she would like shoes and a ring and a hat.</p><p>So this <code>に</code> can be used to and-together two things or a list of things, and it&#39;s completely different from the particle <code>に</code>. It&#39;s a little bit literary, so you&#39;re more often going to see it in written Japanese.</p><p>But if you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s there, you can spend a long time puzzling over what <code>に</code> means in these contexts. It&#39;s also more commonly used in the expression <code>それに</code>, which means <code>furthermore</code> or <code>in addition to that</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>There is a typo in the picture’s orange note. それにとても should be それにしても.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p></div><p>And, as you can see, this is made up of <code>それ</code>, which means <code>that</code>, plus <code>に</code> — not the particle <code>に</code> but the <code>に</code> that means <code>and</code>.</p>',66)]))}const S=h(u,[["render",m]]);export{_ as __pageData,S as default};
