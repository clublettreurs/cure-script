The simple logic behind them.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to discuss <code>ことにする</code> and <code>ことになる</code>. Last week we looked at <code>ようにする</code> and <code>ようになる</code> and we briefly recapitulated the fact that when we say <code>(something)になる</code> we mean that the thing we&#39;re speaking about turned into whatever is marked by に.</p><p>So if we say <code>さくらはカエルになった</code>, we&#39;re saying Sakura turned into a frog.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>If we say <code>にする</code>, we&#39;re saying that someone deliberately turned what we&#39;re talking about into the に-marked noun. So, if we say <code>まじょがさくらをカエルにした</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>the witch turned Sakura into a frog.</code></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>So, what about <code>ことにする</code> and <code>ことになる</code>? We know that <code>こと</code> means a <code>thing</code>, not a concrete thing like a book or pencil <em>(=もの)</em> but an abstract thing, a situation, or a circumstance. <em>(=こと)</em> So, if we say <code>けっこんすることにした</code>, we&#39;re saying literally: It became the thing of getting married.</p><p>Obviously we have to have a zero-pronoun here, because something has to become something. So, what&#39;s <code>it</code>?</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>Well, <code>it</code> is what it might be in English: <code>the situation / the circumstance</code>. <code>The circumstance turned into one in which we&#39;re getting married/in which getting married is the thing.</code> We have to use <code>こと</code> here because, as you know, we can&#39;t attach the logical particle に, or any other logical particle, to anything but a noun.</p><p>So, we use <code>けっこんする</code> as the modifier for <code>こと</code> in order to give us a noun of the situation or circumstance of getting married. So what does it mean? <code>We turned the situation into the thing of getting married</code> means <code>We decided to get married</code> / <code>We brought about a situation in which getting married was the thing</code>.</p><p>And so the textbooks will tell you that <code>ことにする</code> means <code>decide (something)</code>, and it&#39;s not quite as simple as that, as we&#39;ll see in a moment. However, if we say <code>フランスで留学することになった</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>It became the thing of studying in France</code>, which really means <code>It came about that I am going to study in France</code>.</p><p>The situation turned from one in which I&#39;m not going to study in France to one in which I am going to study in France.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>Now because <code>ことにする</code> is a deliberate act done by whoever is making the decision, <code>ことになる</code> is taken to imply in many cases a deliberate decision. So we can translate this most of the time as <code>They&#39;re sending me to France to study</code> / <code>It&#39;s been decided that I&#39;m going to France to study.</code></p><p>The thing to notice here, though, is that there&#39;s no actual mention of a decision by anyone, and in this case it doesn&#39;t matter if we assume that that&#39;s what it means, because it probably does. Some people will say <code>けっこんすることになった</code>, which kind of means &quot;It&#39;s been decided that we&#39;re getting married&quot; or, more literally, &quot;It&#39;s come about that we&#39;re getting married&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>And the reason for saying this is that, even though in this day and age, the people who decide that they&#39;re getting married are almost always the people who are actually getting married, it sounds a little less forceful, a little less ego-centered, not to say <code>we&#39;ve decided...</code> but just to say <code>It&#39;s been decided...</code> or <code>It&#39;s come about...</code> And I have to say that sounds a little bit more pleasant to me as well, but I&#39;m just an android, so what do I know?</p><p>However, we may also say <code>たいへんなことになった</code>, and what that means is <code>It became — the situation became — a terrible thing</code>. And this does not carry any implication that anybody decided it ought to be a terrible thing.</p><p>It does not imply a decision, and there&#39;s no reason it would, because there&#39;s no mention of decision anywhere in <code>ことにする</code> or <code>ことになる</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>In many cases a decision is implied, but in cases like this — and there are many times when you&#39;ll see <code>ことになる</code> working in this way — all it&#39;s telling us is that the situation came about, not that anybody decided that the situation should come about. So this is why it&#39;s important to learn structure in Japanese, because if we just get a handful of Japanese and a handful of English thrown at us — <code>ことになる</code> means <code>it is decided</code> — well, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</p><p>The important thing to know is what&#39;s actually going on in the sentence. Then we can make a sensible assessment ourselves of what&#39;s being said when we see it in an anime or a book or in conversation.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I will just in case put up a further explanation by Dolly-先生, responding to a comment regarding this ことになる/する, which she later pinned, since I feel it can be a bit tricky. <img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""><br> Continuing with - the link is for the Lesson 28 by the way,<br><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p><em>Hopefully this helps a bit in case the lesson explanation was a bit confusing, you can read the other comments <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH3iGBkA93w&amp;list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj&amp;index=31&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>under the video</strong></a> if you want, perhaps some other one may also help.</em></p></div>',26)]))}const S=h(u,[["render",g]]);export{I as __pageData,S as default};
