How 〜ては and 〜ても REALLY work</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today, we&#39;re going to go back and cover that little bit of Alice that we skipped last week and that&#39;s going to give us the opportunity to look at the て-form + は and the て-form + も and some other things too. So we&#39;re going to return to the point where Alice had just taken the marmalade jar off the shelf. <code>でも, びんは空っぽだった</code> – <code>But the jar was empty</code>.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p><code>空/<em><strong>から</strong></em></code> means <code>empty</code>, and you can see it has the kanji for <code>sky</code> <em>(空 as sky is read そら)</em>, which I guess is the biggest empty space in this world. <code>空</code> – <code>empty</code> – is the <code>から</code> in <code>空手</code>, which is the art of fighting with empty hand, without any weapon. <strong><code>空っぽ</code> is a kind of strengthening of <code>empty</code>, meaning there was nothing in it, it was completely empty.</strong> And <strong><code>空っぽ</code> works as a noun</strong>, and generally speaking if you don&#39;t know what kind of word a word is in Japanese, it&#39;s most likely to be a noun.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>Japanese is quite a noun-centered language, because all the words that come in from other languages like Chinese, of which there are a huge amount, and English, and other languages too come in as nouns. <strong>You can turn them into verbs by putting <code>する</code> after them; you can turn them into adjectives with の and -な.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>But fundamentally they&#39;re nouns.</strong> So it&#39;s always a good guess when you don&#39;t know what a word is, that it&#39;s quite likely to be a noun. <code>空っぽ</code> is a noun, <code>empty</code>. <code>でも, びんは<strong>空っぽ</strong>だった</code> – <code>However, the jar was <strong>empty</strong></code>. <code>アリスは空っぽのびんでも下へ落としては悪いと思った.</code> Here again, we&#39;re going to see some other uses of the て-form.</p><h2 id="でも-ても" tabindex="-1">でも / ても <a class="header-anchor" href="#でも-ても" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;でも / ても&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First of all, <code>アリスは空っぽのびん<strong>でも</strong></code>. Now <strong>で here is the て-form of <code>だ</code></strong> , and も, as we know, is the additive, inclusive sister of は: the additive, inclusive non-logical topic-marking particle. So, <code>空っぽのびん<strong>でも</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p><code>で</code>, て-form of <code>です</code>, is <code>it was (an empty jar)</code> – and <code><strong>でも</strong></code> means <code><strong>even though</strong> it was (an empty jar)</code>. <strong>も can be used to mean <code>as much as</code></strong> –<code>一万円もかかった</code> – <code>it took as much as 10,000 yen / cost as much as 10,000 yen</code>) – <code><strong>でも</strong></code> means something like <code><strong>as much as it was</strong> (an empty jar) / <strong>even though it was</strong> (an empty jar)</code>. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00nKUtmnzvI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I&#39;ve done a video</strong></a> on these uses of も that you may want to watch. And we also use this <code>-ても</code> form when asking for permission, don&#39;t we? <code>ケーキを食べてもいい?</code> – <code>Is it all right if I eat the cake? / May I eat the cake?</code> Literally, <code>If I go as far as to eat the cake, will that be all right?</code></p><hr><p><code>空っぽのびんでも下へ落としては悪いと思った</code>. <code>落とす</code> means to <code>drop</code>. It&#39;s another one of our self-move/other-move pairs. <code>落ちる</code> means to <code>fall</code> – that&#39;s self-move: a thing falls, by itself. <code>落とす</code>, which ends in -す, according to the first law of self-move/other-move verbs, so it means <code>drop</code>: we don&#39;t drop ourselves, we drop something else.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p><code>下へ</code> : now, -へ, as we know, is the other targeting particle. It&#39;s very similar to に, <strong>but the difference is that -へ tends to refer more to the direction</strong> <strong>something is moving than to its actual target.</strong> So in this particular case, <code>下に落とす</code> <strong>wouldn&#39;t be right</strong>. We&#39;re not saying that we&#39;re dropping it to a particular target, like <code>テーブルの下</code> – the under of the table / under the table.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>We&#39;re just dropping it downwards, dropping it in a downward direction. We don&#39;t even know what&#39;s down there. She did try looking and she couldn&#39;t see much. So dropping it in the direction of down – <code>下へ落とす</code>. Now, <code>したへ落としては悪い</code>. Now here you see, we&#39;ve just had て-form plus も; now we have て-form plus は. And we know that も and は are the opposite twins. <strong>While も is the additive, including particle, は is the subtractive, excluding particle.</strong> <strong>So, while -ても means <code>as much as</code>, -ては means <code>as little as</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="ては" tabindex="-1">ては <a class="header-anchor" href="#ては" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ては&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>we tend to use -ても in positive contexts</strong> – <code>If I do <strong>as much as</strong> this, will it be all right?</code> <strong>But we use -ては in negative, forbidding contexts</strong> – <code>don&#39;t even do <strong>as little as</strong> that</code>. So we often say, <code>-<strong>ては</strong>だめ</code> – <code><strong>do that is</strong> no good / <strong>do that is</strong> bad</code> / <em>if done (action), no good.</em> In this case, it&#39;s very similar: <code>落とし<strong>ては</strong>悪い</code> – <code><strong>even as little as</strong> dropping it would be bad</code>. The point isn&#39;t really that dropping it is a small thing, or that eating the cake is a big thing. <strong>The point is that we can go as far as eating the cake, that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t even think</strong> <strong>about dropping it:</strong> <code>落としては悪い</code> – doing that is right out of the question. <strong>Very often this forbidding -ては is just contracted to -ちゃ.</strong> 笑っ<strong>ちゃ</strong>だめ！- Don’t laugh! / <em>Even as little as a laugh is no good. (roughly)</em> Now this pattern continues into other uses of -ては.</p><h2 id="ては-as-a-connector-between-two-clauses" tabindex="-1">ては as a connector between two clauses <a class="header-anchor" href="#ては-as-a-connector-between-two-clauses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ては as a connector between two clauses&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For example, we can use -ては as a connector between two clauses and <strong>it implies that the second clause is unwanted or negative.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>So we can say, <code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園に行けない</code> – <code>It&#39;s raining and we can&#39;t go to the park</code>. Now, as we know, -て can connect two sentences and if we just said, <code>雨が降って公園に行けない</code> we&#39;re saying – <code>It&#39;s raining and we can&#39;t go to the park</code>. <strong>There&#39;s an implication that we can&#39;t go to the park because it&#39;s raining but there&#39;s</strong> <strong>no suggestion of whether we&#39;re happy or unhappy with the result.</strong> <code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園にいけない</code> <strong>is indicating that the result is unpleasant or unwanted.</strong> And you can see that <strong>this does have its root in the restrictive quality of は.</strong> For example, in English we might say, <code>Just because it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code> and this is exactly what は means, doesn&#39;t it?</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Bread is the direct object here (like in English).</p></div><p>If we say <code>パンを食べた</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I ate bread</code>, but if we say, <code>パンは食べた</code> <strong>that often implies I ate bread but I didn&#39;t eat something else.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Speaking of the bread, (I) ate. (rough translation), bread is the topic of the convo I guess?</p></div><p>Conversely, if we say, <code>パンを食べなかった</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I didn&#39;t eat bread</code>; if we say <code>パンは食べなかった</code>, <strong>we&#39;re often implying I didn&#39;t eat bread, but I did eat something else.</strong><code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園に行けない</code> originally could imply something like <code><strong>Just because</strong> it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code>, but now <strong>(with ては)</strong> its implication is more <code><strong>Unfortunately, because</strong> it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code>. <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 妹とけんかし<strong>ては</strong>母にしかられた</code> – <code><strong>Because</strong> (I) quarrelled with my sister, I got scolded...</code></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>And again, <strong>the は in there indicates that this is a negative result.</strong> <strong>So it links two complete clauses with the indication that</strong> <strong>the second one follows as an unfortunate result from the first one.</strong> So this is a continuation of the negative implication of -ては.</p><h2 id="ても-でも-as-a-connector" tabindex="-1">ても / でも as a connector <a class="header-anchor" href="#ても-でも-as-a-connector" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ても / でも as a connector&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>-ても, on the other hand, when it links two sentences,</strong> <strong>doesn&#39;t indicate a negative result or a positive result.</strong> <strong>It indicates an unexpected or contrasting result to the first.</strong> So if we said, <code>雨が降っ<strong>ても</strong>公園に行く</code>, we&#39;re saying <code><strong>Even though</strong> <em>(As much as)</em> it is raining, we&#39;re going to the park</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And you can see that this is essentially the same function as <code>でも</code>,</strong> <strong>which gets translated as <code>but</code>, quite correctly.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p><strong><code>でも</code> folds up whatever went before it into that <code>で</code>, which is the て-form of <code>だ</code>.</strong> <strong>So we&#39;re saying <code>that all happened</code> and the も then adds to it the <code>but</code> element,</strong> <strong>the <code>even though</code>, <code>as much as</code> element.</strong> So we could also say, <code>雨が降る<strong>でも</strong>公園に行く</code>, which means almost exactly the same as <code>雨が降っ<strong>ても</strong>公園に行く</code>. The difference structurally is that in <code>雨が降っても</code>, the -ても only attaches to <code>降る</code>, whereas in <code>雨が降るでも</code> the で <strong>is wrapping up the whole of the last sentence.</strong> In practice that gives us pretty much the same meaning.</p><p>So let&#39;s just go back to that sentence in Alice and see how it&#39;s structured.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>It&#39;s a little more complex than it looks at first, but it&#39;s very easy to understand. And if we can understand it it gives us the key to analyzing much more complex sentences which could give us trouble in the future. <strong>The core of the sentence is at the beginning and the end. The whole sentence is just telling us what Alice thought.</strong> So the core is <code><strong>アリスは(zeroが)思った</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p>The inside of the sentence consists of two topic-comment structures. The first topic is <code>even though it&#39;s an empty bottle</code> <strong>(topic)</strong> - (zeroが)空っぽのびんでも and the comment on that is itself another <strong>topic-comment</strong> structure: <code><strong>as for</strong> dropping it, that would be bad</code> - 下へ落として<strong>は</strong>わるい</p><hr><p><strong>And then the whole of this double topic-comment structure is bundled up into that -と, which really means we can treat the whole thing as a kind of quasi-noun – just bundle up</strong> <strong>into that -と and attribute it to Alice as her thought.</strong> <em>(思った)</em> Now, of course, as we&#39;re actually reading or looking at Japanese we don&#39;t think of <code>as for</code> or <code>speaking of</code> every time we see a topic-comment statement, because <code>as for</code> in English is much weightier, much more cumbersome than the simple は and も in Japanese. So what do we do? <strong>Once again, as always, we don&#39;t translate it into English except when we absolutely need to, to explain it or understand it. We take the Japanese as it is in itself, and that&#39;s how we learn Japanese as opposed to just learning about Japanese.</strong></p>',45)]))}const A=p(f,[["render",y]]);export{S as __pageData,A as default};
