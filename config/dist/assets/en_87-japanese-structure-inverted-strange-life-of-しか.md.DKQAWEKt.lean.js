How it really works. Lesson 87</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have any reindeer for you, but I do have a few deer. We&#39;re going to talk about the word <code>シカ / 鹿</code>, which, as you probably know, means <code>deer</code>,</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Just in case, this しか is different to the particle しか of this lesson, hence the Katakana, there is a lot of different しか nouns and whatnot with their own Kanji, but only one particle しか</p></div><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>but there&#39;s another <code>しか</code> element in Japanese which is a particle</strong> <strong>and which has a rather unusual effect on the structure of sentences.</strong></p><p>So we&#39;re going to look into that effect. One of my commenters reminded me of a rather charming Japanese word play:</p><p><code>ならならしかしかしかられない</code>, / <em>奈良なら鹿しか叱られない (how it might be in Kanji form)</em></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>and in natural English we would translate this as <strong><code>In Nara, only the deer get scolded</code>.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s useful to know here that <strong>Nara in the Kansai region is famous for its deer.</strong> People go to Nara to see the deer (and for other things — it&#39;s a lovely historical city).</p><p><strong>Strictly, <code>奈良なら</code> doesn&#39;t mean <code>in Nara</code>.</strong> <strong>It means <code>if it&#39;s Nara</code> or, more naturally, <code>in the case of Nara</code>.</strong> But what does the rest of the structure mean?</p><p>This is what my commenter was really asking. <strong>The question was, &quot;What is the A-car of this sentence?</strong> <strong>Does it have a zero-A-car somewhere, or does it even have an A-car at all?&quot;</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>What is the A-car of a sentence like this? <strong>Now, the problem is partly that <code>しか</code> has</strong> <strong>an unusual effect on the sentence structure,</strong> <strong>but it&#39;s also that the receptive helper is used here</strong> which makes it look a bit more complicated than it is.</p><h2 id="しか" tabindex="-1">しか <a class="header-anchor" href="#しか" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;しか&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So let&#39;s start off with a very simple <code>しか</code> sentence. <code>さくら<strong>しか</strong>いない。</code></p><p>In natural English we&#39;d translate this as, <code>There&#39;s nobody here but Sakura.</code></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>So what&#39;s <code>しか</code> doing here?</strong> <strong><code>しか</code> does two things in a sentence like this.</strong> <strong>It knocks out the が-particle just like <code>か</code>,</strong> so this isn&#39;t something that we&#39;re not already familiar with.</p><p><strong>When you have <code>か</code> in a sentence where there would also be a が,</strong> <strong>we never say <code>がか</code> or <code>かが</code>.</strong> <strong><code>か</code> displaces が, but the が is still logically there.</strong> <strong>That&#39;s what <code>しか</code> also does.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>But the other thing <code>しか</code> does is a little bit more unusual.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever used Photoshop, but in Photoshop you can invert a selection. <strong>What happens is that you select an object,</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>you press the key selection to invert that selection</strong> <strong>and what happens is that everything outside of that object is selected.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>The object is the only thing there now that isn&#39;t selected.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>This is exactly what <code>しか</code> does.</strong> <strong>While が, you might say, selects an object, a noun,</strong> <strong>and marks it as the A-car, the subject of the sentence,</strong> <strong><code>しか</code> selects that noun, inverts the selection</strong> <strong>and marks that as the A-car of the sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>So everything other than that selected noun</strong> <strong>is now the A-car of the sentence.</strong></p><p>So, <code>さくら<strong>しか</strong>いない</code> literally means <code><strong>Everyone other than</strong> Sakura is not here</code>.</p><p>In the deer sentence, which looks a little more complicated, it&#39;s exactly the same thing: <code>奈良なら鹿<strong>しか</strong>叱られない</code> (if it&#39;s Nara, <strong>everything other than</strong> the deer are not scolded).</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>So again, we&#39;re selecting the deer,</strong> <strong>inverting the selection to everything other than the deer,</strong> <strong>and then that becomes the A-car of the sentence, which is <code>not scolded</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, <strong>there&#39;s also an implicit relevance clause in this</strong>, so when we say <code>さくらしかいない</code> <strong>we don&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing here but Sakura:</strong> no trees, no bushes, no flying saucers.</p><p><strong>We mean there&#39;s nobody here but Sakura.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>Now, the <code>いない</code> partly tells us that</strong>, but it isn&#39;t just that, because <strong>it also <strong>doesn&#39;t mean</strong> that there are no bunny rabbits here</strong>, <strong>there are no birds, there are no capybara</strong> (did I pronounce that right?)</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>It should simply select the relevance that <strong>no other Sakura / no other people</strong> are there.</p></div><p><strong>So <code>しか</code> inverts the selection, but it&#39;s also</strong> <strong>what you might call a <code>smart invert</code>: it selects for relevance.</strong></p><h2 id="しか-in-sentences-with-が-marked-subject" tabindex="-1">しか in sentences with が-marked subject <a class="header-anchor" href="#しか-in-sentences-with-が-marked-subject" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;しか in sentences with が-marked subject&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>However, in some <code>しか</code> sentences there is actually</strong> <strong>a が-marked subject, so what&#39;s going on here?</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at one. Suppose we say, <code>タオル<strong>が</strong>一枚<strong>しか</strong>ありません</code>.</p><p>Again, in natural English: <code>There&#39;s <strong>only</strong> one towel here.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Notice how in Japanese they use ありません after しか here.</p></div><p><strong>The が-marked subject is <code>towel</code> or <code>towels</code>.</strong> <strong>In Japanese, of course, there&#39;s no distinction between those two things.</strong></p><p>And as I explained in my lesson on counters<sup><a href="./71-japanese-counters-3-simple-rules">[71]</a></sup>, <strong>a counter in this kind of sentence is working as an adverb.</strong> <strong>It&#39;s telling us more about the engine of the sentence, the verb.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>泥棒が<strong>三人</strong>いる</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>robbers*(=subject)* exist three-<strong>person-ly</strong></code>. If we say <code>タオルが<strong>一枚</strong>ある</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>towel*(=subject)* <strong>one-flat-thing-ly</strong> exists</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>タオルが<strong>二枚</strong>ある</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>towel*(=subject)* <strong>two-flat-thing-ly</strong> exists</code>.</p><p>So when we say <code>タオルが<strong>一枚</strong>しかありません</code>, <strong>the subject is <code>towels</code></strong>, <strong>then we have the counter <code>一枚</code> and that is marked by <code>しか</code>.</strong> <strong>So we&#39;re selecting one flat thing, one towel,</strong> <strong>and then inverting the selection to all towels.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Not all flat things, because we&#39;ve already marked the subject as <code>towel</code>.</strong> <strong>So we&#39;re inverting the counter, which is working adverbially,</strong> <strong>from one towel to every towel but that one towel.</strong></p><p>So we&#39;re saying <code>towels, <strong>everything but one</strong>, non-exists</code>. In natural English, <code>There&#39;s <strong>only one</strong> towel</code>.</p><p><em><code>タオルが<strong>一枚しか</strong>ありません</code></em></p><p>And that&#39;s how what we might call the inverse-selection structure of a <code>しか</code> sentence works.</p><h2 id="しかない-colloquial" tabindex="-1">しかない (Colloquial) <a class="header-anchor" href="#しかない-colloquial" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;しかない (Colloquial)&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>And I should just add at the end that</strong> <strong>there is a use of <code>しか</code> that&#39;s more colloquial.</strong> <strong>And this is when we say <code>しかない</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, in an ordinary <code>しか</code> sentence obviously we just say <code>この古い車<strong>しかない</strong></code>, which means in natural English <code>There&#39;s only this old car.</code></p><p><strong>We&#39;re selecting the car, inverting the selection:</strong> <code><strong>all cars other than</strong> this old car <strong>non-exist</strong></code>.</p><hr><p><strong>But we can also put that <code>しかない</code> at the end of a logical clause</strong> <strong>or a verb standing in for a logical clause.</strong> <strong>Now, this isn&#39;t strictly grammatical, but colloquially it often happens.</strong></p><p>So if you hear in an anime somebody saying <code>逃げる<strong>しかない!</strong></code>, they&#39;re saying <code>(we) <strong>gotta</strong> run!</code> in natural English. What they&#39;re literally saying is, <strong>we take this <code>逃げる</code>,</strong> <strong>we mark it with <code>しか</code> so that what we&#39;re selecting</strong> <strong>is not <code>逃げる</code> (run) but everything else other than run.</strong></p><p>And again, <strong>the relevancy smart selection comes in here.</strong> What we&#39;re really saying is <code><strong>every course of action other than</strong> running <em>(away)</em> <strong>doesn&#39;t exist</strong></code>.</p><p>Well, of course it does exist, <strong>this is very colloquial</strong>, but as far as we&#39;re concerned it doesn&#39;t exist: <strong>there&#39;s nothing for it but to run</strong> <em>(away)</em>.</p><hr><p><strong>In English</strong> we might say, <code><strong>It&#39;s run or nothing</strong></code>, and again, <strong>that&#39;s ungrammatical and for the same reason</strong> <strong>that the Japanese is ungrammatical, that <code>run</code> isn&#39;t a noun.</strong></p><p><strong>But, when that thing&#39;s coming after you, who cares about grammar?.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Some useful comments I guess under the video…</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p><em>One miscellaneous about くせに (癖に?), for the full lesson, she made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvuNXIYqFNM&amp;pp=ugMICgJqYRABGAHKBRRjdXJlIGRvbGx5IOOBj-OBm-OBqw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this video</strong></a></em> <em>/ Lesson 93</em><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p></div>',75)]))}const A=w(v,[["render",k]]);export{E as __pageData,A as default};
