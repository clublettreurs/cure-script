Lesson 83</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about ways of making commands and requests in Japanese. You&#39;ll probably know some of these already, but I think we&#39;re going to go a little bit deeper to some things you may not have realized.</p><p><strong>We&#39;re going to go from the least commanding and intense towards the most</strong>, so we&#39;ll start off with one that we all know, which is the て-form.</p><h2 id="the-て-form" tabindex="-1">The て-form <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-て-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The て-form&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Some sources will tell you that the て-form on its own is a command or request form. <strong>That&#39;s only half true. It&#39;s the abbreviation of a command or request.</strong></p><p>If we say <code>ちょっと待って</code> (wait a little), <strong>this is an abbreviation</strong> of <code>ちょっと待ってください</code> (wait a little please)</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>and probably because of this it&#39;s the one that&#39;s least likely to be offensive, although <strong>it&#39;s still casual.</strong></p><p>Now, sometimes you&#39;ll hear people saying not <code>ちょっと待って</code> but <code>ちょっと待って<strong>て</strong></code>. What&#39;s going on here?</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>Essentially what they&#39;re saying is <code><strong>Wait a little bit and I&#39;ll be back</strong></code>. <strong>The implication is that the waiting period will end fairly shortly.</strong></p><p>And what this actually is is a contraction of <code>ちょっと待って<strong>いて</strong></code>. As we know <code>待っている</code> means <code>exist in a state of waiting</code>, <code>be waiting</code>, in English. <strong>So <code>ちょっと待ってて</code> is actually taking this <code>待っている</code> and putting it into て-form</strong>, <strong>so that what you&#39;re being asked or instructed to do is exist in a state of waiting.</strong></p><p>And the implication of this is, <strong>just exist for a little bit in a state of waiting.</strong> <strong>And of course this doesn&#39;t have to be waiting, it can be anything,</strong> <strong>but the implication is, just do it for a bit, just exist in that state for a short time.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>If we don&#39;t say <code>ちょっと</code></strong> (and we don&#39;t necessarily) <strong>there&#39;s nothing to indicate a short time, but that is always the implication</strong> <strong>of telling someone with the て-form to exist in a particular state.</strong></p><h3 id="て-form-with-ない-helper-adjective" tabindex="-1">て-form with ない helper adjective <a class="header-anchor" href="#て-form-with-ない-helper-adjective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;て-form with ない helper adjective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The other thing to know about the て-form which is used to tell or ask someone to do something is that, as we know, <strong>the equivalent negative adjective of any verb</strong> <strong>is made by simply attaching the helper adjective <code>ない</code> to the あ-stem.</strong></p><p><strong>And the helper adjective <code>ない</code> actually is unusual in that it has two て-forms.</strong> It has the regular て-form, which is formed just like any other て-form, by attaching -て to the く-stem, so that&#39;s <code>なくて</code>, <strong>but it also has the irregular て-form <code>ないで</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>And when attached to a verb this is only used in two kinds of circumstance.</p><h4 id="ないで-irregular-て-form-of-ない" tabindex="-1">ないで - irregular て-form of ない <a class="header-anchor" href="#ないで-irregular-て-form-of-ない" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ないで - irregular て-form of ない&quot;">​</a></h4><p>One is when we say <code>do B without doing A</code>, so <code>話さないで歩く</code> means <code>walk without talking</code>. <strong>The other is when we&#39;re making that て-formed command or request.</strong></p><p>And again it&#39;s short for <code>ないでください</code>. So if we say <code><strong>泣かないで</strong></code> (don&#39;t cry), <strong>that&#39;s using this secondary, specialized て-form of <code>ない</code></strong>, <strong>which is specifically there for making negative commands or requests</strong>, <strong>as well as for the one other usage that we discussed.</strong></p><p>And sometimes in anime you&#39;ll hear someone scream, when a monster is approaching her, <code>来ないで!</code> (don&#39;t come).</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>In English we&#39;d probably say <code>Keep away!</code> In Japanese we say <code>来ないで!</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p></div><h2 id="なさい" tabindex="-1">なさい <a class="header-anchor" href="#なさい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なさい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, next up in our hierarchy of commands is <code>なさい</code>. <strong><code>なさい</code> is attached to the い-stem of verbs</strong>, and <strong>when you attach <code>なさい</code> to the い-stem of a verb, you make it into a command.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>So, <code>起きなさい</code> is <code>get up / wake up</code>; <code>落ち着きなさい</code> (calm down, settle down), <strong>we&#39;re attaching <code>なさい</code> to the い-stem of <code>落ち着く</code>,</strong> <strong>which means <code>calm down</code> or <code>settle down</code> and turning it into a command.</strong></p><hr><p><strong><code>なさい</code> is the sort of command given by parents to children,</strong> <strong>teachers to a class, that sort of thing.</strong> <strong>It&#39;s not offensive if it&#39;s given by someone who&#39;s entitled to give it.</strong></p><hr><p>So, for example, in the anime <code>借りぐらしのアリエッティ</code>, Arietty&#39;s father says <code>寝なさい</code>. <strong>That&#39;s the い-stem, which of course with ichidan verbs we make by simply</strong> <strong>removing the -る, of <code>寝る</code></strong> (sleep, or go to bed) <strong>plus <code>なさい</code></strong>.</p><h3 id="な-the-abbreviation-of-なさい" tabindex="-1">な - the abbreviation of なさい <a class="header-anchor" href="#な-the-abbreviation-of-なさい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;な - the abbreviation of なさい&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Something that can be confusing here is that there is an abbreviation of <code>なさい</code></strong> <strong>which can be confused with a different abbreviation meaning the opposite.</strong> <strong>And that abbreviation is <code>な</code>.</strong></p><p>When we attach <code>な</code> <strong>to the い-stem of a verb</strong>, then we&#39;re actually abbreviating <code>なさい</code>. <strong>So if we say <code>準備しな</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>準備しなさい</code> (get ready, get prepared)</strong>: <code>準備する</code>, い-stem of <code>する</code>, <code>し</code> + <code>なさい</code> or <code>な</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, that in itself isn&#39;t particularly confusing. What can confuse people is that if we say, for example, <code>バカにするな</code> (don&#39;t make fun of me, of her);</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p><code>それを食べるな</code> (don&#39;t eat that! [could be poison]). <strong>This means the opposite!</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re using <code>な</code> for both a command to do something</strong> <strong>and a command not to do something.</strong> So how do we tell the two apart? Fortunately, it&#39;s very easy.</p><p><strong>If the <code>な</code> is attached to the い-stem, then it&#39;s an abbreviation of <code>なさい</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>It always is.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>If it&#39;s not attached to the い-stem but attached to the entire logical clause</strong> <strong>as in <code>それを食べるな</code>, then it is not an abbreviation of <code>なさい</code>.</strong> <strong>It&#39;s in fact an older negative related to <code>ない</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>So really, although they can seem confusing at first and they&#39;re probably confusing when you&#39;re told by some textbook just to learn which particular forms they stick to, it&#39;s not really confusing in practice.</p><p><strong>One only attaches where <code>なさい</code> would attach to the い-stem,</strong> <strong>and that&#39;s the one that means <code>なさい</code>!</strong> <strong>The other one tops off a complete logical clause with the negativizing <code>な</code>.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Some further info Dolly gives about なさい in the comments</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p></div><h2 id="the-real-command-imperative-form-命令形" tabindex="-1">The real command / imperative form - 命令形 <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-real-command-imperative-form-命令形" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The real command / imperative form - 命令形&quot;">​</a></h2><p>And now we come to the real command form, <code>命令形</code> in Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And this is formed very simply by using the bare え-stem of a godan verb or,</strong> <strong>in the case of an ichidan verb, we take off the -る as always, and replace it with -ろ.</strong></p><p>So you might hear people say in an anime <code>黙れ!</code> <strong>That is the verb <code>黙る</code></strong> (to be quiet, to be silent) <strong>turned into a command:</strong> <strong><code>Be quiet!</code></strong></p><p><strong>And this is really pretty forceful.</strong> <strong>It&#39;s stronger and potentially more offensive than <code>うるさい!</code></strong> (And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jBOq1EHwvs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I made a video on <code>うるさい</code></strong></a> if you want to follow that up.)</p><p><strong>It&#39;s not inherently offensive,</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>the 命令形 form</p></div><p><strong>If someone really has the right to be giving orders, they may use it.</strong> <strong>And people who talk rough may use it among friends or to enemies.</strong></p><p>You may hear it a lot in shounen anime, where people do tend to talk rough. <strong>It can also express urgency in a few cases.</strong> <strong>One case that you&#39;ll often hear is when a character is in serious trouble</strong> <strong>and calls out <code>助けてくれ！</code> which is like <code>助けてください！</code></strong> <strong>but turning it into a real order, a command.</strong></p><p>Now, obviously someone in deep trouble isn&#39;t trying to insult or offend anyone who might help him. <strong>So what this <code>くれ</code> is doing in this case is expressing the urgency of the situation.</strong></p><p>Yet even here, I&#39;d have to say that I&#39;ve only ever heard <strong>male characters use this <code>助けてくれ</code>.</strong> Female characters, even in the direst emergency, will tend to content themselves with <code>助けて!</code></p><p><strong>And this shows how delicate the real <code>命令形</code> command form actually is.</strong> <strong><code>くれ</code> is really the only irregular <code>命令形</code> apart from</strong> <strong>the two regular irregulars, which are <code>する</code> and <code>くる</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>So <code>くれる</code> (to give down / to me) becomes <code>くれ</code>.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Obviously, as shown, the くれ is a form of <strong>くれる</strong>; not くる/来る (that one has こい/来い)</p></div><hr><p>And, as you see, <strong>it&#39;s a particularly touchy kind of word to use,</strong> <strong>because you&#39;re asking for a favor but you&#39;re demanding it,</strong> <strong>you&#39;re commanding someone to do a favor down to you.</strong></p><p>Now, for completeness, I&#39;d say that there are two other ways of commanding that are mostly used for other things but can be used as command forms as well.</p><h2 id="のだ-んだ-ending" tabindex="-1">のだ / んだ ending <a class="header-anchor" href="#のだ-んだ-ending" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;のだ / んだ ending&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>One is the <code>のだ / んだ</code> ending which is put at the end of a complete logical clause,</strong> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYvIOi8Q3I8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I&#39;ve made a video about this <code>のだ / んだ</code> ending</strong></a>, and I&#39;ll put a link to that over my head and in the information section below.</p><p>As I explain in the video, <strong>it has a wide range of uses</strong>, <strong>but one of those uses is turning something into a command.</strong> So if we say <code>宿題をする<strong>のだ</strong></code>, we&#39;re saying literally <code><strong>It&#39;s that</strong> (you) do (your) homework</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>This will be somewhat like the English <code>You&#39;re going to do your homework</code>. <strong>It&#39;s a command.</strong></p><h2 id="ように" tabindex="-1">ように <a class="header-anchor" href="#ように" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ように&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Also, <code>ように</code>, which as an ender would tend to be more associated with</strong> <strong>prayers and petitions and requests, can also form a command.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p></div><hr><p>And the main reason I mention these is because <strong>if you come across them</strong> <strong>in your immersion and you see something that usually is doing something else</strong> <strong>looking like a command, <code>のだ</code> or <code>ように</code>, then don&#39;t be puzzled by it.</strong> <strong>In these cases, it is a command.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This might be useful:</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt=""></p></div>',84)]))}const P=b(_,[["render",I]]);export{N as __pageData,P as default};
