One of the things people often ask me about are the various sentence-enders they encounter. And I&#39;m not talking about the tame ones like <code>ね</code>, <code>よ</code> and <code>な</code> – I&#39;ve done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEok4Ivfyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>a video</strong></a> about those if you&#39;re interested and I&#39;ll pop a link for that over my head.</p><p>But today we&#39;re going to talk about some of the more colloquial and unconventional sentence-enders that you&#39;re going to run into once you get into <code>wild Japanese</code><br> in anime, manga, etc.</p><h2 id="かい" tabindex="-1">かい <a class="header-anchor" href="#かい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, one of the ones I often get asked about is <code>かい</code>,<br> and <code>かい</code> is simply a softened and colloquial form of <code>か</code>. As we know, <code>か</code> is regularly used in formal Japanese, where we use the です/ます decorations at the end of sentences, to form questions. So we say <code>何々しますか / 何々ですか</code>.</p><p>But in colloquial Japanese we don&#39;t use <code>か</code> as a sentence-ender question-marker all that often. <strong>We do use it in other positions</strong> — and I&#39;ve done a video about the various ways we use <code>か</code><sup><a href="./39-the-か-particle-buried-questions-かな-もんか-かどうか">[39]</a></sup> and I&#39;ll pop a link for that over my head too. But where we don&#39;t tend to use it in informal speech, on the whole, is at the end of sentences marking questions, the way it does in です/ます Japanese.</p><p>And that&#39;s not because it&#39;s ungrammatical, in fact it&#39;s perfectly grammatical, but in modern Japanese it&#39;s come to sound a little bit rough, so while you may hear it between men who are being <code>one of the boys</code> together, you don&#39;t hear it so often in female speech or in the speech of anyone who&#39;s trying to be a bit courteous. So what do we do? Most of the time we simply use a rising intonation in speech or a question mark in writing where we&#39;re depicting casual speech. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with this.</p><p>Spanish continually makes questions by simply adding a rising intonation to the equivalent statement and there are no problems there. There are no problems in Japanese either. Sometimes we add <code>の</code>, which is ambiguous, because it can mark either a question or a statement, but again that doesn&#39;t really matter because intonation works just as well.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>However, we do have the informal, non-rough-sounding question-marker <code>かい</code>. You might think that would be used all the time, <strong>but it isn&#39;t</strong>,<br> because it sounds very colloquial indeed and sometimes a little bit... well, folksy. Some sources say it&#39;s primarily masculine and that&#39;s kind of half-way true. You don&#39;t hear many younger female speakers using it, but you do sometimes hear older female speakers using it.</p><h2 id="だい-どうだい" tabindex="-1">だい (&amp; どうだい) <a class="header-anchor" href="#だい-どうだい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だい (&amp; どうだい)&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>かい</code> also has a partner, which is <code>だい</code>.</p><p><strong><code>だい</code> is really <code>だ</code> plus <code>かい</code>.</strong></p><p>So this is the form of <code>かい</code> that we use in<br> copula-ending sentences, <code>だ</code>-ending sentences.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>And just about everything I&#39;ve said about <code>かい</code> also applies to <code>だい</code>,<br><strong>except</strong> that there is a particular collocation, <code>どうだい</code>, which is much more widely used. So, if somebody&#39;s eating something and you say <code>どうだい?</code> — <code>what&#39;s it like? / how is it?</code> — and they might say <code>おいしい/美味しい!</code> or they might say <code>まずい/不味い</code>, but <strong>asking it in that form is something anybody can do provided it&#39;s an informal setting.</strong></p><h2 id="ちょうだい" tabindex="-1">ちょうだい <a class="header-anchor" href="#ちょうだい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ちょうだい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>People also come across the expression <code>ちょうだい</code>, <strong>and that&#39;s not related to <code>かい</code> or <code>だい</code> at all;</strong><strong>it&#39;s an informal equivalent to <code>ください</code>.</strong> So it&#39;s usually adding it to the て-form of a verb to ask someone to do something. It&#39;s sometimes considered to be female speech <strong>but it is not exclusively so.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="ぜ、ぞ、さ" tabindex="-1">ぜ、ぞ、さ <a class="header-anchor" href="#ぜ、ぞ、さ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ぜ、ぞ、さ&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Other real sentence-ender markers in casual speech are <code>ぜ</code>, <code>ぞ</code> and <code>さ</code>. Now, <code>ぜ</code> and <code>ぞ</code> are very simple. They&#39;re just verbal exclamation marks which lend a little force to whatever it is you&#39;re saying. <strong>They&#39;re quite rough and really are masculine speech</strong><strong>and they&#39;re the sort of thing you&#39;ll probably see</strong><strong>more in anime and manga than you will in real life.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p><code>さ</code> is similar but it&#39;s not nearly so rough. <strong>It&#39;s much more widely used</strong>, you&#39;ll see a lot of it, and you&#39;ll hear it in real life. It tends to get called masculine speech, but again <strong>it&#39;s not exclusively masculine speech</strong>. All kinds of people use it.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s important not to confuse <code>さ</code>, the emphasis-lending sentence-ender,</strong><strong>to <code>さあ</code>, which comes at the beginning of a sentence and is more of a pause-for-thought kind of expression.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, there are also sentence-enders <strong>that are not sentence-enders but effectively they are</strong>, because people do pop them after the engine at the end of a sentence.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""><br> Here, Dolly also suggests watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au5JOtcwE7A&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>video</strong></a> on pseudo-enders, のに &amp; なのに respectively.</p><p>One of these is <code>から</code>.</p><h2 id="から-sentence-ender" tabindex="-1">から <code>sentence-ender</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#から-sentence-ender" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;から &lt;code&gt;sentence-ender&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <code>から</code>, as you know, <strong>is not technically a sentence-ender.</strong><strong>What it is is a conjunction that joins two logical clauses to make a compound sentence.</strong> So a proper use of <code>から</code> might be: <code>さくらが来ないから帰ります</code>, which means<br><code>Because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, I&#39;m going home / Sakura isn&#39;t coming, so I&#39;m leaving</code>.</p><p>However, you might simply say as you are leaving, <code>さくらが来ないから</code>,<br> and that is just leaving the other half of the sentence unsaid because it&#39;s obvious. Now, from that, <code>から</code> can be added to a lot of sentences to imply that something else is coming.</p><p><strong>That extra something else isn&#39;t always completely clear.</strong> In fact, the <code>から</code> may be performing the function of either softening what it marks or hardening it.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>It can soften it by making the statement feel explanatory; it can harden it by making it sound as if it&#39;s part of a logical argument or a natural piece of reasoning that the hearer ought to understand and agree with.</p><p>So, for example, if you&#39;re riding your bicycle in a place where you shouldn&#39;t be riding a bicycle and somebody official comes up to you and says <code>自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから</code> [polite tone], that&#39;s conciliatory, and really all they want to say is <code>It&#39;s forbidden to ride a bicycle around here</code>, but by adding the <code>から</code> to the end of it, they&#39;re kind of softening it, turning it into an explanation for you.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>Conversely, they might say <code>自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから</code> [stern tone], and that has a different implication. There, the <code>禁止</code> is being rammed home all the harder for that <code>から</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>So, <code>から</code> can have a variety of uses, often depending on context, on the way in which they&#39;re said, on the demeanor of the person saying them, and on the whole situation.</p><h2 id="し-sentence-ender" tabindex="-1">し sentence-ender <a class="header-anchor" href="#し-sentence-ender" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;し sentence-ender&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>し</code> is another very common sentence-ending particle which is similar to <code>から</code> and has a meaning in the same area. <code>し</code> can actually combine various conditions or statements, <strong>but its most common and regular use is to combine reasons.</strong></p><p>So, for example, we might say, <code>遅くなったしさくらが来ないし帰ります</code>, and that means &quot;Because it&#39;s gotten late and because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, I&#39;m going home&quot;. And <strong>this is the most standard kind of use of <code>し</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>But then we might often use it for only one condition, implying others. For example, if we said <code>遅くなったし帰ります</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>because it&#39;s gotten late, I&#39;m going home</code>, <strong>but we&#39;re also implying that the fact that it&#39;s gotten late isn&#39;t the only reason:</strong> <code>Because it&#39;s gotten late (and for other reasons) I&#39;m going home.</code></p><p>And this, in this particular case, probably implies that it&#39;s not just because it&#39;s getting late, <strong>it&#39;s also because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, but we&#39;re leaving unstated the more personal part of it.</strong></p><p>Now conversely, we might say <code>さくらが来ないし帰ります</code> and this time we&#39;ve put in the most important part, the real reason for our leaving, but by saying <code>し</code> rather than <code>から</code> we&#39;re also saying <code>Because Sakura isn&#39;t coming (and for other reasons) I&#39;m leaving.</code></p><p><strong>What this does is take the pressure off Sakura.</strong> Although she may be the main reason, we&#39;re diffusing it a bit by suggesting that there are also other reasons. <strong>And we might do this when there are no other reasons at all,</strong><strong>just as a way of softening and diffusing the statement.</strong></p><p>Another example might be, suppose you&#39;re riding your bicycle again in that place where you shouldn&#39;t be riding it and this time a friend comes up to you and says, <code>自転車に乗るのは禁止し</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Yes, normally, after 禁止, there would be だ before し. But since this is casual, it is left off.</p></div><p>Now, <strong>the difference between this and the <code>から</code> statement</strong><strong>is simply that the <code>し</code> is diffusing it.</strong> It&#39;s saying &quot;Oh, because it&#39;s forbidden to ride a bicycle here and for other reasons...&quot;</p><p><strong>Now, there aren&#39;t any <code>other reasons</code> at all, but</strong><strong>what this does is make it sound a bit more colloquial, a bit more friendly</strong>,<br> and it vagues up a bit that <code>から</code> which can sound too much like an order. It&#39;s just saying <code>Oh, for that and other reasons</code>.</p><p>And this <code>vaguing up</code> tactic often takes place in languages. In English it&#39;s often done by adding words like <code>like</code> or <code>kinda</code> to what you&#39;re saying.</p><p>Now, the ways in which these sentence-enders work can&#39;t be learned from structure alone or from abstract instruction alone. <strong>We need to immerse in Japanese to get the feel of</strong><strong>what people mean when they say these things.</strong></p><p>But conversely, understanding the structure, understanding how they really fit together, gives us a substantial boost in being able to make sense of our immersion. It&#39;s rather like a rope and climbing a mountain.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Indeed, ‘tis modified a bit …somewhat…*cough*…bizarrely… ╮(︶▽︶)╭<br> *If you have a rope, that will help you climb the mountain,</p></div><p>but if you just stand staring and learning all about the rope you&#39;ll never get to the top of the mountain. Conversely, if you try to climb the mountain without the rope, you may not get very far…</p>',60)]))}const x=h(m,[["render",f]]);export{I as __pageData,x as default};
