And I&#39;m going to deal with them together because I think they can throw a little light on each other. And before we begin, I&#39;ll just say that if you have any words that are causing you trouble, bringing you to a halt in understanding things in your immersion, please put them in the Comments below and I&#39;ll either reply right away or add them to my list of things to deal with.</p><hr><p>Right, so, <code>ほど</code> and <code>くらい</code>. <strong>They&#39;re both nouns, of course.</strong></p><p><strong>Practically everything in Japanese that isn&#39;t a verb or an adjective, as we know, is in practice a noun or a noun-like entity.</strong></p><p>So, what is a <code>ほど</code>? What is a <code>くらい</code>?</p><p><strong>Both of them represent an extent or an amount of... anything: time, money, distance, etc.</strong></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>However, the main difference between them is that <code>ほど</code> tends to imply that the amount or degree involved is great,</strong></p><hr><p><strong>and <code>くらい</code> either marks it as indefinite, as something we&#39;re not sure about, or in some cases which we&#39;ll talk about a bit later, that it is small, that it&#39;s less than we might have expected or hoped.</strong></p><p>So, to illustrate this difference, let&#39;s look at them both in a very simple construction. <strong><code>これくらい</code> means: about this much, about this amount, about this far, about this fast,<br> about this temperature, whatever.</strong></p><p><strong><code>これほど</code> means: this much, this amount, this hot, this cold, but it&#39;s stressing that this is a large extent, a large degree.</strong></p><h2 id="ほど" tabindex="-1">ほど <a class="header-anchor" href="#ほど" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ほど&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, if we say <code><strong>これほど悪い</strong>とは思わなかった</code>, we&#39;re saying, <code>I didn&#39;t think it was <strong>this bad</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>So, the <code>これ</code> (this) modifying <code>ほど</code> is not only saying <code>this bad</code>, it&#39;s saying that <code>this bad</code> is a lot, this is more than we might have expected or desired.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>Negatively</strong>, if we say <code><strong>それほど</strong>悪くない</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>it&#39;s not <strong>that</strong> bad</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>what&#39;s <code>それ</code> referring to in a case like this?</strong></p><p><strong>It can be referring to something we&#39;ve already referred to, to a degree or an extent that we&#39;ve already been discussing,</strong> but also, just as in English, <strong><code>それ</code> (or <code>that</code>) can simply mean an amount that we might have expected.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So, again, the thing modifying <code>ほど</code>, the <code>それ</code>, represents a great amount, an upper limit, and then we&#39;re falling short of that upper limit marked by <code>ほど</code>.</strong></p><p>So, <code><strong>それほど</strong>悪くない</code> means <code>not <strong>that</strong> bad</code> — <strong>either not that bad</strong> as we have been discussing or as is implied in the conversation, <strong>or simply <code>not that bad</code></strong>, which works exactly the same as it does in English — <strong>the <code>that</code> when there&#39;s no reference point simply means what we might have expected or what it might have been.</strong></p><p>So if we say in English <code>it&#39;s not that bad</code>, we mean <strong>it&#39;s not very bad, it&#39;s not as bad as it might have been.</strong></p><hr><p>And the same with <code><strong>それほど</strong>悪くない</code>. <strong>If we&#39;re not referring to a specific, defined <code>that</code>, then we&#39;re saying <code>it&#39;s not <strong>very</strong> bad / it&#39;s not <strong>all that</strong> bad</code>.</strong></p><p>And again, <strong><code>ほど</code> is often used to mark one side of a comparison, and once again <code>ほど</code> represents the greater side, the upper limit.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>私は彼女<strong>ほど</strong>若くない</code> we&#39;re saying <code>I&#39;m not <strong>as</strong> young <strong>as</strong> she is</code>,</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>I&#39;m not young <strong>to the extent that</strong> she is, and <strong>her extent</strong> is <strong>the higher extent</strong> <strong>and therefore it&#39;s the one modifying <code>ほど</code>.</strong></p><h3 id="ほど-as-a-noun" tabindex="-1">ほど as a noun <a class="header-anchor" href="#ほど-as-a-noun" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ほど as a noun&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, <strong><code>ほど</code> can be used as an almost independent noun representing the upper limit of something.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>不可能<strong>なほど</strong></code>, we&#39;re saying (<code>不可能</code>: <code>可能</code> means possible; <code>不可能</code> means impossible) <code>不可能な<strong>ほど</strong></code> means <strong>the upper limit of</strong> impossibility.</p><p><strong>This is not just <code>不可能</code>, not just impossible, it&#39;s the <code>ほど</code> of <code>不可能</code>, it&#39;s the upper limit of <code>不可能</code>, it&#39;s the height of impossibility.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>Or <code>不快<strong>なほど</strong>失礼</code> — <code>不快</code> is unpleasant, dislikeable; <code>失礼</code>, of course, is rudeness. This is rudeness <strong>to the upper limit of</strong> unpleasantness / dislikeableness.</p><hr><p>And these <strong><code>ほど</code>s where we use an adjectival noun and add <code>なほど</code></strong> — <strong>the upper limit of that adjectival noun, using that adjectival noun to modify the <code>ほど</code></strong> — <strong>very often they tend to be negative things but they can be more neutral,</strong> for example, we might say <code>不思議<strong>なほど</strong></code> — <strong>the upper limit of</strong> mysteriousness, absolutely mysterious.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This phrase above is apparently an expression that can also mean <code>wondrous/marvellous</code></p></div><p><strong>And another commonly used expression with <code>ほど</code> is <code>ほどがある</code>, and this really means an upper limit exists.</strong></p><p><strong>And this is usually used in complaining about something.</strong></p><p>So we say <code>冗談にも<strong>ほどがある</strong></code>, which is literally saying even a joke <strong>has an upper limit</strong>, and what that usually means is, what you&#39;re saying / what you&#39;re doing <strong>goes beyond</strong> a joke.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>Jokes have <strong>an upper limit</strong> and you&#39;ve passed it. <code>バカにも<strong>ほどがある</strong></code> (stupidity <strong>has an upper limit</strong>), which is a bit like saying, <code>Even you can&#39;t be that stupid</code> or you&#39;ve passed <strong>the upper limit of</strong> stupidity.</p><h3 id="ほど-for-forming-comparisons" tabindex="-1">ほど for forming comparisons <a class="header-anchor" href="#ほど-for-forming-comparisons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ほど for forming comparisons&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>And perhaps the commonest use of <code>ほど</code>,</strong> the one that you&#39;ll probably see all the time, <strong>is its use in forming comparisons.</strong></p><p>Now, <strong>there are various kinds of comparison in Japanese, but <code>ほど</code> is used particularly when we&#39;re stressing the extreme quality of something.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s often used for comparisons that are essentially exaggerations but making the point that something is very much whatever it is we&#39;re saying it is.</strong></p><p>So, we might say, <code>死ぬ<strong>ほど</strong>暑い</code> (it&#39;s hot <strong>to the extent of</strong> dying); <code>肌を刺す<strong>ほど</strong>寒い</code> (it&#39;s cold <strong>to the extent of</strong> penetrating the skin);</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p><code>信じられない<strong>ほど</strong>美しい景色</code> (scenery that&#39;s beautiful <strong>to the extent of</strong> being unbelievable).</p><hr><p><strong>And this <code>ほど</code> which is used for exaggeration, for literary purposes, just for making a point very strongly, is probably the <code>ほど</code> that you&#39;re going to see more of the time than any other.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s a very common use of <code>ほど</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="くらい" tabindex="-1">くらい <a class="header-anchor" href="#くらい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;くらい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, let&#39;s look at <code>くらい</code>. <strong><code>くらい</code> is most commonly used for approximation.</strong></p><p>So we might say, <code>到着するのは八時<strong>ぐらい</strong>です</code> — we&#39;re saying we&#39;re arriving <strong>at approximately</strong> eight o&#39;clock.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p><code>八百円<strong>ぐらい</strong>です</code> (it&#39;s <strong>around</strong> eight hundred yen).
