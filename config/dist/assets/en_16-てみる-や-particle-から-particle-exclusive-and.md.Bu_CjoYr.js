So, if you remember from last time, Alice had just entered the rabbit hole and quite surprisingly she finds herself falling very slowly down a vertical hole.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>落ちる間にひまがたっぷりあってまわりをゆっくり見まわせた</p></blockquote><p>Now, I&#39;m going to tell you what this means first and then we&#39;re going to break it down.</p><p><code>落ちる間に</code></p><p><code>落ちる</code>, as we know, is <code>fall</code>. <code>間</code> is a period of time <strong>and it&#39;s also the space between two things.</strong> And obviously a period of time is always, metaphorically speaking - and we can only really talk about time in spatial metaphors - a period of time is always a space between two points, isn&#39;t it? It has a beginning and it has an end. So <code>落ちる間に</code> means <code><strong>while</strong> (she) was falling / <strong>during the period of time while</strong> (she) was falling</code>.</p><hr><p><code>ひま</code> means <code>free time / open time</code>. It&#39;s a word you&#39;ll see quite often, and <strong>it can be used in both a positive or a negative sense</strong>. <strong>It can mean free time to do what you want to do, or it can mean empty time, being bored, having time hanging on your hands.</strong> Here it just means having plenty of time available to look around, because she&#39;s falling, she can&#39;t do anything else, and she&#39;s falling rather slowly.</p><hr><p><code>たっぷり</code> means <code>in large quantities</code>. <strong>It&#39;s another one of these り-ending adverbs that don&#39;t need に.</strong> And it means <code>in large quantities / in plentiful amounts</code> - rather like pouring from a tap: <code>たっぷり</code>, <code>in large quantities</code>. And <strong>here it&#39;s an adverb describing the fact that the <code>ひま</code>, the <code>free time</code>, exists.</strong> <strong>So the free time exists in large quantities.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>So that&#39;s our first logical clause: <code>落ちる間に…</code> (<strong>which simply sets the scene, the time, for the action - it&#39;s an absolute time expression because it&#39;s a particular time, so it takes に</strong>) <code>...ひまがたっぷりあって</code> (<code>there was a lot of free time</code>).</p><hr><p>Now, the next part - <code>まわりをゆっくり見まわせた</code> - is interesting because this is another example of what we were talking about last week: self-move/other-move pairs.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p><code>回る</code> means to <code>go around/move around</code>. The rather childish name for a policeman is <code>おまわりさん</code>, which means <code>someone who goes around / someone who does the rounds</code>.</p><hr><p><code>回す</code> means <code><strong>make (something)</strong> go around / <strong>to send (something)</strong> around / to cause it to go around</code> and of course, as we learned last week, we easily know which of the pair is the self-move word (going around) and which is <strong>the other-move word</strong> (sending around) because the sending-around one <strong>ends in -す</strong>.</p><hr><p>Now, we don&#39;t actually have <code>回る</code> here; we have <code>まわり</code>. And as we&#39;ve mentioned before, <strong>when we take the い-stem of a verb and use it on its own it usually becomes a noun.</strong> There is another use which we&#39;re not going to enter into right now, but in this case it is becoming a noun. So, what does <code>まわり</code> mean? <code>まわり</code> can actually mean two things: <strong>it can be the noun-form of <code>回る</code></strong>, in which case it&#39;s <code>going around</code>, <code>doing the rounds</code>, and that&#39;s what we have in <code>おまわりさん</code>, a policeman - here&#39;s someone who does the act of doing the rounds, <strong><code>まわり</code> is <code>the act of doing the rounds</code>,</strong></p><hr><p><strong>but it can also mean <code>the surroundings</code></strong>, and in this case it actually takes a different kanji to show that it&#39;s a slightly different meaning of the word.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>It’s this Kanji - 周り.</p></div><p><strong>It&#39;s still the noun-form of <code>around</code>, but in this case it&#39;s the surroundings, not the act of going around.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><strong>The top right orange まわる should be まわす.</strong> (Dolly-先生 admits <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_jePzcPFAQ&amp;lc=UgzlHz19j_bcvzKlnGl4AaABAg.9CT4jGElSLJ9CTDDRs1sOu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>in the comments</strong></a>)</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p></div><p>So, <code><em>(zeroが)</em> まわりをゆっくり見まわせた</code> means <code>(she) could in a leisurely manner…</code></p><p>(<code>ゆっくり</code>, that adverb we learned last week<sup><a href="./14-adverbs-and-the-も-particle">[14]</a></sup>)</p><p>she could in a leisurely manner <code>見まわす</code></p><p>What does <code>見まわす</code> mean?

Various things passed through her eye, passed through her vision, and the thing that stopped there was what we are going to talk about. But we also need to look at this use of の. As we&#39;ve seen before, の is like apostrophe-s (&#39;s) in English. So if we say <code>さくらのドレス</code>, we&#39;re saying, <code>Sakura&#39;s dress</code>.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p><p>Now also, just as in English, if you say, <code>Which dress do you like best?</code> Suppose that Sakura and Mary are both wearing dresses and you say, <code>Which dress do you like best?</code> In English you might say, <code>Sakura&#39;s. I like Sakura&#39;s best</code>. You could say, <code>Sakura&#39;s dress</code> but you don&#39;t have to, you can just say, <code>Sakura&#39;s</code>. <strong>And it&#39;s the same in Japanese.</strong> <strong>You can say</strong> <em>(just)</em> <strong>, <code>さくらの</code> - Sakura&#39;s, the one that belongs to Sakura.</strong> But this can be taken much further in Japanese, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq3GO63D9bw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I&#39;ve done a whole video</strong></a> about this particular use of の, which you can look at if you want to go deeper.</p><hr><p>But in this case the way it&#39;s taken further is <code>目に止まるの</code> - this is <code>the thing, the one that stopped in her eye</code>. <code>Which dress do you like best?

Well, we&#39;ll get to the <code>や</code> in just a moment, but <code>とだなや本だな</code>. The word for a shelf in Japanese is <code>たな</code>, and when we add something before it to tell us what kind of a shelf it is, we use that <code>ten-ten hooking</code> <em>(〃)</em> that we&#39;ve talked about before.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Lesson 5, <code>The third &amp; fourth Godan group</code>.</p></div><p>So the <code>た</code> becomes <code>だ</code>: <code>とだな</code> - that <code>と</code> means <code>door</code>, so literally, <code>とだな</code> is a <code>door-shelf</code> and that is the Japanese word for a cupboard. And it&#39;s quite a good word, I think. That&#39;s what a cupboard really is, isn&#39;t it? Shelves, with a door. It&#39;s a better way of saying cupboard than the English way which says it&#39;s a board on which you put cups, which isn&#39;t quite what a cupboard is. <code>本だな</code> is even easier: it&#39;s quite literally a book-shelf, bookshelves.</p><h2 id="the-や-particle-exclusive-and" tabindex="-1">The や particle + exclusive <code>and</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-や-particle-exclusive-and" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The や particle + exclusive &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, this <code>や</code> is something we need to cover. When you want to say <code>and</code> - something <code>and</code> something else - how do you say it in Japanese? We know that when you&#39;re putting two clauses together, we use the て-form, or sometimes we use other things, like <code>でも</code>. In English we use <code>and</code> in all cases: we say <code>bread and butter</code>, <code>pencil and paper</code>. We also say <code>I went into the baker&#39;s and bought some bread.</code> <strong>But in Japanese we don&#39;t use the same <code>and</code> in the two cases.</strong> We already know some of the ways we can <code>and</code> two clauses together, but when we&#39;re <code>anding</code> two things together, there are two ways to do it. And one is to use the と-particle. We know that the と-particle is the quotation particle, <strong>but it&#39;s also the and-particle.</strong> So if you want to say <code>pen and book</code>, we say <code>ペンと本</code>. <strong>But we can also use the や-particle, so we can say <code>と</code> or <code>や</code> when we want to <code>and</code> together two or more objects.</strong> What&#39;s the difference?</p><hr><p>Well, as a matter of fact it&#39;s a very useful difference, and one that we could do with in English. <strong><code>と</code> is an exclusive <code>and</code>.</strong> If I say, <code>What&#39;s in that box?</code> and you answer <code>ペンとえんぴつ</code> - <code>pens and pencils</code> - <strong>you are telling me that there are pens and pencils and nothing else in that box.</strong></p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt=""></p><p>If you say <code>ペンやえんぴつ</code>, you&#39;re saying there are pens and pencils <strong>and there might also be something else</strong> - <strong>and very often you&#39;re implying that there is something else because you&#39;re avoiding using the exclusive <code>and</code>.</strong> So what <code>stopped in her eye</code> was the fact that cupboards and bookshelves <strong>(among other things)</strong> were tightly lined around the walls.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt=""></p><hr><p><img src="'+v+'" alt=""></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>取り下ろした in the video has an extra ろ in its 下 furigana.
