The yin-yang structure of Japanese | Lesson 61</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about the subtler meanings of the は- and が-particles and the implications they can have in different uses. Last week<sup><a href="./60-the-other-half-of-japanese-structure-non-logical-topic-comment-structure">[60]</a></sup> we looked at the fact that topic-comment structure is fundamental to Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>Every Japanese sentence has a topic as well as a subject, so that we can say that where the topic and the subject are not made explicit, Japanese sentences have both an invisible が and an invisible は. So, <code>日本人です</code>, meaning <code>I am a Japanese person</code>, is strictly <code>zeroはzeroが日本人です</code> — <code>I am the topic, I am the subject, and I am a Japanese person.</code></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>On the whole, we don&#39;t need to worry about the invisible は, and that&#39;s because in English and related languages we don&#39;t normally need to have the topic made explicit. We do need to have the subject repeatedly made explicit, so we feel a bit lost if we don&#39;t know where it is. And that&#39;s why we use the invisibleが model.</p><p>But the important thing that we concluded in our last lesson was that the so-called choice between は and が, which only exists, of course, in sentences where the topic and the subject happen to be the same thing, and what we&#39;re doing is not really making a topic or making a subject: we are emphasizing the fact that something is either the topic or the subject. And this choice is important for the implication we&#39;re going to throw on that topic/subject. And in order to understand the implication, we do have to have some idea of what is the most natural way of putting a thing.</p><p>And this is why I always say that structure is important, but you can&#39;t understand Japanese with structure alone. <strong>You have to have enough immersion to understand what sounds natural.</strong> And from that plus the use of structure you can understand what implications are being made by a particular statement.</p><hr><p>Now, when we treat something as a topic and mark it with は or も, <strong>this can&#39;t be new information.</strong> Just as in English if we say, <code>Speaking of Melfrog Pooftoofular</code>, it&#39;s no good saying that if your hearer doesn&#39;t know who or what <code>Melfrog Pooftoofular</code> is. You have to start by introducing <code>Melfrog Pooftoofular</code> first.</p><p><strong>So a topic-marker can only mark old information.</strong> And this is important because old information is unimportant information. New information is what you are actually trying to convey to someone. This is the way language works. We&#39;re not supposed to be telling people things they already know. We&#39;re supposed to be adding something that they don&#39;t know, and that is the actual information content of the statement.</p><p>So, in a certain way, は works like <code>the</code> in English, only in this one respect, that it can&#39;t mark new information. So if we say <code>I fed the iguana</code>, unless people already know about this iguana, they&#39;re immediately going to say, &quot;What iguana? You never talked about any iguana before. What are you talking about, &#39;the iguana&#39;?&quot;</p><p>If you say <code>I fed an iguana</code>, that&#39;s all right. And we also need to understand that <strong>this concept of old versus new information and important versus unimportant information is closely bound up.</strong></p><p>So you can in fact say <code>I fed the dog</code> without anybody knowing that you even had a dog, because it&#39;s very normal and natural for a person to have a dog. They don&#39;t particularly want to stop and have that point explained anyway. So <code>I fed the dog</code> will be taken to mean <code>I fed the dog that I keep at home, even though you didn&#39;t know I kept a dog at home, you do now</code>.</p><p>If I say <code>I fed the iguana</code>, that&#39;s a conversation stopper. If you don&#39;t introduce the iguana first, nobody&#39;s going to just take it as read — <code>Yes-yes, she&#39;s got an iguana at home, like most people.</code></p><p>So you see that while we say linguistically <code>new information</code> versus <code>old information</code>, it&#39;s a bit subtler than that. It&#39;s <code>new, important, relevant information</code> versus <code>old information or information that we can easily take as read</code>. And even this is quite a heavy-handed way of describing it.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at how this sort of thing works in practice in Japanese. If we say <code>本を買った</code>, this is the most normal way of saying <code>I bought a book</code>. As we know, the zero-pronoun defaults to <code>I</code> when the context isn&#39;t telling us that it&#39;s anything else. So <code>本を買った</code> puts no particular emphasis on anything; it&#39;s just saying, neutrally, <code>I bought a book</code>.</p><p>Now, in this sentence, <code>I</code> is the subject and the topic. If we choose to stress <code>I</code> as the topic and say <code>私<strong>は</strong>本を買った</code>, <strong>we&#39;re making <code>私</code> into the old information, the buying of the book into the new information, and because of this, は has a distinguishing function.</strong></p><hr><p>When we use は, we are either establishing or changing the topic.<br> And even establishing a topic is in most cases changing it, because we can assume there was some topic before. So we&#39;re changing the topic to <code>I</code> and saying that I bought a book.</p><p>And we know that what は does is not only change the topic to whatever it marks (in this case <code>I</code>) <strong>but it also implies that the comment on the new topic<br> is different from the comment on the old topic.</strong> And if there wasn&#39;t in fact an old topic, it still implies that it&#39;s different from the comment <strong>on other possible topics.</strong></p><p>So, <code>私は本を買った</code> is essentially saying &quot;What I did was bought a book. You may have bought something else, other people may not have bought anything at all, but what I did was buy a book.&quot; We&#39;re stressing the fact that <strong>I bought a book as opposed to other possible topics</strong> <strong>who didn&#39;t buy a book.</strong></p><p>This means that it is implicitly the answer to a question which may not in fact have been asked: <code>What did you do?</code> The answer to <code>What did I do?</code> is <code>I bought a book</code> when you&#39;re marking <code>I</code> with は.</p><hr><p>Now, if you say <code>私が本を買った</code>, you&#39;ve changed the emphasis. <strong>You&#39;ve reversed the emphasis.</strong> The old information is now the buying of the book and <strong>the new information is <code>I</code>.</strong></p><p>So under what circumstances do you say that? Well, suppose people are looking at an empty space in the bookshelf and wondering what happened, and you say <code>私が本を買った</code> – <code>I&#39;m the one who bought the book.</code> We all know that the book&#39;s gone, we know something happened to the book, now I&#39;m giving you the new information: <strong><code>I</code> am the one who bought the book.</strong></p><p>So while <code>私は本を買った</code> is implicitly the answer to the question <code>What did you do?</code>, <code>私が本を買った</code> is implicitly the answer to <code>Who bought the book?</code></p><hr><p>It&#39;s also important to understand what is the natural, neutral way of saying something. We know in this case that the natural, neutral way of saying <code>I bought a book</code> without emphasizing anything is just to say <code>本をかった</code>.</p><p>So if we say <code>私は</code> or <code>私が</code>, <strong>we&#39;re specifically making a point here.</strong> <strong>We&#39;re adding something to the neutral statement that I bought a book.</strong></p><p>Now, from this direction of the emphasis forward or backward,<br> は, and が can mark particularities as opposed to generalities.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>花が綺麗だ</code>, we&#39;re stressing the <code>花</code> as the subject and this means <code>The flower (or these flowers) are pretty</code>. <code>Pretty</code> is important, but the real subject is <code>these flowers</code>. These flowers are what is pretty, these are pretty flowers.</p><p>If we say <code>花は綺麗だ</code>, we are likely to be saying that flowers in general are pretty. We haven&#39;t singled out any flowers as the subject; we&#39;ve made <code>flowers</code> the topic, and the important new information is prettiness. <strong>Flowers in themselves are not new.</strong> They&#39;re something we&#39;ve known about for a long time. <strong>The fact that they&#39;re pretty is my comment, my assessment of them.</strong></p><p><code>花が綺麗だ</code> – the flowers are taken to be something new. They&#39;re taken to be a particular subject in themselves and so we&#39;re more likely to be talking about particular flowers instead of flowers in general.</p><hr><p>Now, all the time we&#39;re talking about tendencies here, aren&#39;t we? There&#39;s no logical, structural reason why saying <code>I fed the iguana</code> is any different from saying <code>I fed the dog</code>. It becomes different because of expectations.</p><p>We expect someone is very likely to have a dog and so this is not new or important information. We don&#39;t expect someone to have an iguana, so this counts as new, important information and you can&#39;t slip it by with a <code>the</code> in the same way that you can the dog.</p><p><strong>Similarly, が can mark new material as well as old material,<br> but は can&#39;t mark new material.</strong> <strong>は can mark specific things as well as generalities but が can&#39;t really mark generalities.</strong></p><p>So we&#39;re talking about fairly subtle shades here. Now, knowing the usual way of saying something, again, is what gives using a different strategy its emphasis.</p><p>So, as I spoke about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l_ZlQQU4ZE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>an earlier video</strong></a> on は and が (which I would recommend seeing, because it covers some material I&#39;m not covering here) we know that <code>雨が降っている</code> means <code>it&#39;s raining</code>. This is the normal way to say it&#39;s raining. We use が. We can&#39;t use nothing because we have to say what&#39;s falling, and we don&#39;t normally use は.</p><p>So <code>雨が降っている</code> simply means <code>rain is falling</code>. <code>雨は降っている</code> is something you&#39;d say when perhaps there was an expectation that it was going to snow.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>Rain is the topic and the comment on it is that it&#39;s falling, with the implication that if the topic were different the comment would also be different, because <strong>we&#39;re using は</strong> not も, and <strong>は is the exclusive topic-marker as opposed</strong> <strong>to も, which is the inclusive topic-marker.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, it&#39;s not only used for differentiation; it&#39;s also used because it throws emphasis forward. It&#39;s also used for emphasis.</p><p>So I&#39;m going to take an example here from one of my favorite anime, which is Aria the animation. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it has any Japanese subtitles, so you may have to wait a little while before you watch that. I know you never watch anything with English subtitles any more and I congratulate you for that.</p><p>So the sentence is <code>おまえみたいな半人前に休みはない</code>. <code>おまえみたいな半人前に休みはない</code> And what this means is <code>For trainees like you, there are no rests</code>.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s interesting to notice what&#39;s going on here. What is the topic of this sentence? Actually, it&#39;s <code>trainees like you</code>: <code>おまえみたいな半人前に</code> could have been <code>おまえみたいな半人前には</code> and this would made a topic out of <code>trainees like you</code>, and the comment on this would be the logical clause <code>休みがない</code> — <code>there are no rests</code>.</p><hr><p><strong>However, the speaker has chosen to do something different.</strong> <strong>She&#39;s chosen to de-emphasize the topic by not marking it with は,</strong> <strong>but this doesn&#39;t stop it being the topic.</strong> It&#39;s still the topic on which the logical clause is a comment.</p><p>And <strong>she&#39;s made a sub-topic out of <code>休み</code> — <code>rests</code>.</strong> Why has she done that?</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>Because when you make something a topic, even if it&#39;s a kind of sub-topic like this,</strong> <strong>you&#39;re throwing the emphasis forward onto what follows it.</strong> You&#39;re making the thing that follows it the salient, the important information of the sentence.</p><p>So, what it&#39;s saying here is <code>休みは <em>(zeroが)</em> ない</code> — <code>As for rests, <em>(they)</em> don&#39;t exist</code>: <code>For trainees like you, as for rests, <em>(they)</em> don&#39;t exist.</code> Now, this isn&#39;t quite as cumbersome as it sounds in English because は is a much more flexible particle that can be used much more easily than things like <code>as for</code> in English.</p><p>But it&#39;s using the same essential strategy to throw all the emphasis of that entire sentence onto that last word, <code>ない</code> — <code>they don&#39;t exist</code> — <code>forget about rests, you&#39;re not getting any.</code></p><p>Now, I hope this makes the topic-marking は and the subject-marking が a little bit clearer in their deeper and subtler implications…</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This may be quite a difficult thing to grasp, as always, comments under <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-hK4-qv9Yk&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>the video</strong></a> may perhaps help a bit.
