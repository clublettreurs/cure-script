And we&#39;re going to do that by continuing with the <code>怪談</code>, the Japanese story, that we&#39;ve been reading over the last few lessons by courtesy of our Japanese partner channel, Akasic Tails.</p><p>And we&#39;re going to be covering such a lot of points this time that I&#39;ll put up cards for some of the main ones but I&#39;ve also made a supporting <a href="http://learnjapaneseonline.info/2019/08/10/groping-in-the-darkness-links-to-structure-points-covered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>page</strong></a> on Kawajapa where you can go and look up any of these points and follow them up if you need to do so. And I think it would be a very good idea to follow up anything that you&#39;re not absolutely clear about after we go through this story.</p><p>Now, to remind you where we got to at the end of last week&#39;s lesson, our heroine had gone to a drinking party at her senpai&#39;s apartment. After she left the party and was walking home at night, she became aware that she&#39;d left her <code>携帯電話</code>, her portable telephone, in senpai&#39;s apartment. So she went back, pressed the bell, but there was no answer, turned the handle of the door and found that it wasn&#39;t locked.</p><p>So she walked right in.</p><p>So, let&#39;s see what happened next.</p><p><code>部屋の中は電気がついておらず</code></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, so long as we understand that <code>電気をつける</code> means <code>turn on the lights</code> (literally it means <code>turn on the electricity</code>, but it in fact refers to the lights), the only problem with this clause is <code>おらず</code>. What does that mean?</p><p>Well, <code>おる</code> means the same as <code>いる</code>, which is to <code>be</code>.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p>Generally we&#39;re told that it means to <code>be</code> of animate beings, like animals and people. It&#39;s not quite as simple as that and I&#39;ve explained that in another lesson, which I&#39;ll <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsTsliRe2Cg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>link</strong></a>. <code>おる</code> is a rather older form of <code>いる</code>, but we encounter it in a variety of circumstances.</p><p>For example, it is used in keigo as a humble form, <code>謙譲語/けんじょうご</code> form, of <code>いる</code> which we use to humble our own actions and possessions, but it&#39;s also used in dialect, in Kansai-ben for example, and it&#39;s used in literary contexts to give a literary narrative feel. And that&#39;s how it&#39;s being used here.</p><p>So, <code>おる</code> means <code>いる</code>, but what does <code>おらず</code> mean? Well, you also have to understand that <code>-ず</code> is also a piece of older Japanese which gives a literary feeling to a narrative and it&#39;s simply a negative helper like <code>-ない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>So why is it <code>おらず</code>? Well, that&#39;s because while <code>いる</code>, as we know, is an ichidan verb, <code>おる</code>, as it happens, is a godan verb. So, as with all godan verbs, the negative helper is attached to the あ-stem.</p><p>So that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. <code>おらず</code> means the same as <code>いない</code>.</p><p>So, <code>電気がついておらず</code> means <code>the electricity existed in a state of not having been switched on</code> or, in plain English, the lights were off.</p><p><code>真っ暗で</code>: <code>真っ暗</code> is <code>pitch-dark</code>, literally <code>true dark / complete dark</code>. <code>暗</code>, of course, we know as <code>暗い</code>, the adjective <code>dark</code>, and we know that when we see an adjective without its -い on the end, if it makes a word at all, it will be a noun.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>We also know that if we see a word that is all kanji, it&#39;s almost certainly going to be a noun. So <code>真っ暗</code> is <code>pitch darkness</code>.</p><p><code>真っ暗で</code> — the <code>で</code> here is the て-form of <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code>. So, <code>部屋の中は電気がついておらず真っ暗で</code> — <code>As for the inside of the room, the lights were off, it was pitch dark</code>.</p><hr><p><code>どうやら先輩はもう寝てしまったらしい</code></p><p><code>どうやら</code>: in this case means <code>it seems, it appears to be the case</code> and this is actually working in tandem with the <code>-らしい</code> at the end, which also means <code>seems like, appears to be</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>And we&#39;ve covered this in a previous lesson<sup><a href="./25-らしい-vs-そうだ-そうです-っぽい-ppoi">[25]</a></sup> as well.</p><p>So in between this sandwich that gives us the <code>it appears to be the case</code> meaning, it says <code>先輩はもう寝てしまった</code> — <code>senpai has already done gone to sleep / done gone to bed</code>. As we know, that <code>しまう, しまった</code> gives that <code>done</code> meaning. And that&#39;s really the best way to put it in English.</p><p>It sounds a bit rustic in English, but there&#39;s nothing else in English which I think gives that sense of <code>しまう, しまった, ちゃった</code> quite as well as <code>done</code>. She&#39;d already done gone to bed, it seemed.</p><p><code>無用心だな</code>: <code>無用心</code> means literally <code>not using one&#39;s heart</code>, but <code>heart</code> here means mind or spirit. <code>用心</code> is <code>care</code> or <code>cautiousness</code>; <code>無用心</code> is <code>lack of care</code> or <code>lack of cautiousness</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>An alternative writing is 不用心. They should mean the same thing.</p></div><p>But this particular word <code>無用心</code> tends to mean lack of cautiousness in relation to criminal or other hostile activity. So we might say that walking alone in a dangerous place is <code>無用心</code> or leaving valuables on display in our car is <code>無用心</code>. And here, leaving her door unlocked at night so anybody could just walk in is <code>無用心</code>.</p><p><code>無用心だな</code>: <code>な</code>, as we know, is the particle used for directing a comment at ourself, so she&#39;s thinking to herself <code>無用心だ</code> — it&#39;s reckless, dangerous behavior.</p><p><code>無用心だな、と思った彼女は</code>: so, she, who was thinking this, <code>電気をつけて先輩を起こそうかと思ったが</code>.</p><p>All right, so this looks a little bit complicated and we still haven&#39;t finished the sentence, but let&#39;s just take it bit by bit. First of all she thought <code>無用心</code> — <code>unsafe, dangerous behavior</code>; <code>she thought</code> — <code>と思った彼女</code> — she who thought that, then thought something else; <code>電気をつけて</code> — <code>点ける/つける</code>, of course, is the other-move version of <code>点く/つく</code>, so she thought of switching on the lights; <code>先輩を起こそう</code> — now, as we know, that <code>そう</code> ending is a volitional ending; <code>起こそうか</code> — she thought about taking the action of awakening senpai.</p><p><code>起こす</code> —to <code>wake someone up</code>; <code>起きる</code>, you wake up yourself; <code>起こす</code> — -す endings, as we know, mean other-move verbs, so <code>起こす</code> is to wake someone else up. <code>起こそうか</code> — so, she&#39;s thinking about this action.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p>The <code>か</code>, as we know from another lesson<sup><a href="./39-the-か-particle-buried-questions-かな-もんか-かどうか">[39]</a></sup>, marks a question, that&#39;s to say, a proposition. So the proposition was taking the action of waking up senpai.</p><p>This is what she thought, but... (<code>が</code> — <code>but</code>) <code>先輩がかなり酔っていたのをおもいだし、</code>. So, <code>かなり</code> is another one of those adverbial nouns that can modify a verb or an adjective without the に or -と that&#39;s usually needed for a noun to modify a verb or an adjective, so <code>かなり酔っていた</code> — <code>酔う</code> is to <code>be sick or to be drunk</code>, in this case <code>drunk</code>.</p><p><code>かなり</code> means <code>sufficiently</code> or <code>pretty much</code> or <code>very</code>. So she was pretty drunk, she was in the state of being pretty drunk: <code>かなり酔っていたの</code> — the <code>の</code> of course bundles that statement into a noun box — <code>のを思い出し</code> — <code>思い出し</code> is <code>remember</code>, so she remembered the fact — the <code>の</code> — that senpai had been pretty drunk.</p><p><code>思い出す</code> is <code>remember</code>; <code>思い出し</code>, once again, as we discussed last week<sup><a href="./7-5-conjugation">[7.5]</a></sup>, is the い-stem of <code>思い出す</code> — <code>remember</code> — and the い-stem here <em>(the し)</em> is being used like the て-form to make this clause a part of a compound sentence.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>So we have a three-fold compound sentence now. First of all, we use <code>が</code> — <code>but</code> — as the connector for the first part, and the second part we&#39;re using -し like the て-form as the connector for the third part, and the third part is <code>そっとしておくことにした</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p><code>そっと</code> is another one of these adverbial nouns, meaning <code>softly, gently or quietly</code>. <code>そっとする</code> means to <code>do softly, gently or quietly</code>. It&#39;s like <code>静かにする</code>, which means to <code>do quietly</code>.</p><p><code>そっとする</code> means also to <code>do quietly</code>, but <code>静か</code> means more <code>keep quiet</code>. You might say this to a class: <code>静かに!</code> — <code>Keep quiet!</code></p><p><code>そっとする</code> is more to <code>do (something) in a quiet manner</code>. Now, <code>静か</code> can be used in that way too, but <code>そっとする</code> means to do something quietly; it can even mean secretly.</p><p><code>静か</code> can&#39;t mean secretly; <code>そっと</code> can mean secretly. Here it doesn&#39;t mean secretly, but it does mean doing something quietly so that someone else won&#39;t be aware of you doing it, which is the kind of implication that <code>そっと</code> often tends to have.</p><p><code>そっとしておく</code> — <code>しておく</code>, as we know, is to <code>put in place an action</code>. <code>置く/おく</code> means to <code>place (something)</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>Attaching <code>おけ</code> to the て-form of a verb means putting that action in place. And, as we know, the textbooks often say it means <code>doing it in advance</code> or <code>doing it in preparation</code>, but actually it means <code>putting the action in place</code>.</p><p>So she&#39;s essentially saying here, <code>do what she has to do, put her action in place, quietly</code>. <code>そっとしておくことにした</code>: now, <code>ことにする</code>, as we&#39;ve also covered in a previous lesson, means <code>decide to do</code>. So this last bit means she decided to put her action quietly into place, literally.</p><p>So we&#39;ve got this whole sentence here:</p><p><code>無用心だな、と思った彼女は電気をつけて先輩を起こそうかと思ったが、 <em>(zeroが)</em> 先輩がかなり酔っていたのを思い出し、 <em>(zeroが)</em> そっとしておくことにした</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>So, &quot;<strong>That</strong>s dangerous, isn&#39;t it, leaving the door open,&#39; she thought; she considered switching the lights on and awakening senpai, but she remembered that senpai had been pretty drunk and so she decided to do what she had to do quietly.&quot;</p><p><code>真っ暗の中で自分の携帯電話を探し出すと</code> –</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><p>&quot;In the pitch darkness — 真っ暗の中で — 自分の携帯電話 — her own telephone — 探し出す&quot;. <code>探し出す</code>: <code>探す</code> as we know, is <code>search</code>; <code>探し出す</code> is literally <code>search out</code>, so she sought it out, she found it — <code>と</code>.</p><p>****「忘れ物をしたので取りに戻りましたー」とひと声かけて部屋を後にした&quot;</p><p>So she said something aloud here, but presumably quite quietly so that she wouldn&#39;t wake senpai. She said: <code>忘れ物</code> — <code>forgotten thing</code> — <code>をしたので</code> — &quot;I did a forgotten thing / I forgot a thing / I left a thing behind<code> — </code>忘れ物をしたので&quot; — because of that — <code>取りに戻りました</code> — <code>I came back to take it / in order to take it, I returned</code> — <code>とひと声かけて</code> — <code>声 (を) かける</code> is to say something to someone, to engage them in conversation, here <code>ひと声</code> — she just said that single word, she just said that single voice, literally, she just said that — <code>部屋を後にした</code> — so she just said that, presumably quietly so that senpai wouldn&#39;t even hear her, but she felt she ought to say something — <code>部屋を後にした</code> — <code>後にする</code> literally means to <code>turn it into behind</code>, in other words, put it behind you, in other words, leave — she left the room — <code>部屋を後にした</code> — she made the room the thing behind her by leaving it.</p><p>And that was that for the evening. Well, she got out of that all right, didn&#39;t she?</p><p>It was a bit scary, but we didn&#39;t hear what happened the next day. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to talk about next week..</p>',65)]))}const A=l(w,[["render",f]]);export{S as __pageData,A as default};
