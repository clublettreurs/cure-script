It can be confusing because nobody really explains exactly what it is and what it does — and of course they certainly don&#39;t explain why. A number of people have asked me about this recently including my Red Kokeshi patron Bob Nagler, who says, &quot;Have you ever done a video of verb plus <strong>まい</strong>? I&#39;ve not found a very useful explanation anywhere, only lists with examples and translation which give somewhat of an idea.&quot;</p><p>Well yes, that is pretty much the state of play. So let&#39;s do the video now.</p><h2 id="what-is-まい" tabindex="-1">What is まい？ <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-まい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is まい？&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong><code>まい</code> is a negative helper like <code>ず</code> and <code>ぬ</code></strong>, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Qop8dwP4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I did a video on</strong></a> quite recently.</p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>And like them it&#39;s something of a fossil, one of those elements that&#39;s not quite at home in modern Japanese. But it&#39;s used quite a lot, so we need to understand it.</strong></p><hr><p>The first unusual thing about it is that unlike most helpers, <strong>it doesn&#39;t attach to one of the verb stems.</strong></p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>It gets stuck straight onto the end of the verb in most cases.</strong> So if we want to put it onto <code>行く</code> we just say <code>行くまい</code>.</p><p><strong>This is always the case with godan verbs because there&#39;s no other way of attaching <code>まい</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>With ichidan verbs we can attach it to the universal ichidan stem</strong> (as you know, with ichidan verbs we always, whatever we&#39;re doing with them, we always just take off the -る and put on whatever we want to put on). So, for example, <code>見る</code> can become <code>見まい / みまい</code>, <strong>but just as often it&#39;s</strong> <code>見るまい</code>.</p><p><strong>With the two irregulars</strong>, <code>来る</code> and <code>する</code>, <strong>they can be</strong> <code>来るまい</code> and <code>するまい</code>, <strong>but they can also be</strong> <code>こまい</code> and <code>しまい</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, <strong>strictly speaking, certainly in the past, using ichidan verbs in their entirety with <code>まい</code> on the end was probably ungrammatical, but now it&#39;s so widely done that it&#39;s generally accepted.</strong> You&#39;ll see it everywhere on the television news or anywhere.</p><hr><p>So what is this <code>まい</code>? Well, <strong>it&#39;s really a sort of sister to the helper adjective <code>ない</code>, which is the negativizing adjective.</strong> What&#39;s the difference between <code>まい</code> and <code>ない</code> apart from the way it attaches?</p><p>Well, <strong>what <code>まい</code> actually is is the volitional form.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>adjectives don&#39;t usually have volitional forms, but in this case we do, and it has certain uses.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Like <code>ない</code>, <code>まい</code> is an adjective, but unlike <code>ない</code> and just about every other adjective, it doesn&#39;t morph in any way.</strong></p><p><strong>You don&#39;t say <code>まくて</code> or <code>まかった</code>. You only ever use it in its simple, unchanged form, <code>まい</code>,</strong> so it is, in a way, a static element in Japanese, not an active element.</p><p><strong>And this actually is quite natural, because it&#39;s the same with the positive volitional, isn&#39;t it?</strong> We have て-forms and past forms of helpers like the receptive and the causative and, of course, <code>ない</code> itself, but <strong>we don&#39;t have past and て-forms, etc., of the volitional.</strong></p><p><strong><code>食べよう</code>: you don&#39;t put that into the past, it doesn&#39;t have a て-form, because that doesn&#39;t really make any sense with a volitional.</strong></p><h2 id="what-a-negative-volitional-cannot-do" tabindex="-1">What a negative volitional cannot do <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-a-negative-volitional-cannot-do" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What a negative volitional cannot do&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So what does a negative volitional actually do?</p><p><strong>It doesn&#39;t do all the things that a positive volitional does.</strong></p><p><strong>You can&#39;t use it as a call to action:</strong> <code>行きましょう</code> (let&#39;s go). <em>(this example is positive volitional)</em></p><p><strong>You can&#39;t say <code>行くまい</code> (let&#39;s not go) — it doesn&#39;t mean that.</strong></p><p><strong>You can&#39;t use it for</strong>, as I&#39;ve shown in another video<sup><a href="./18-って-は-mysteries-explained-おうとする-とする-として-という-っていう">[18]</a></sup>, <strong>forming a construction that means <code>try to do something</code>.</strong></p><p>So <strong>you can&#39;t use <code>まい</code> in let&#39;s-try-not-to-do-type constructions.</strong></p><h2 id="the-uses-of-まい" tabindex="-1">The uses of まい <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-uses-of-まい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The uses of まい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Its uses are pretty limited; it has a couple of direct uses and then a couple of other uses which are really quite useful. So, let&#39;s look at them.</p><h3 id="using-まい-to-say-that-something-is-unlikely" tabindex="-1">Using まい to say that something is unlikely <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-まい-to-say-that-something-is-unlikely" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using まい to say that something is unlikely&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Its most usual use by a long way is saying that something is unlikely.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""></p><p><strong>It&#39;s a volitional negative, so just in the same way that we can voice conjectures or assessments</strong> — and <strong>this is very often used with the verb <code>ある</code>, so we say <code>あるまい</code>.</strong></p><p><code>そんなことはあるまい</code> (that&#39;s just not likely / I don&#39;t think such a thing is probable at all).</p><p><strong>But it works just the same with any other verb.</strong></p><p><code>この降りでは彼はこまい</code> (In this downpour, I doubt if he&#39;ll come).</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt=""></p><p>And <strong>this is rather related to the other adjectives of subjectivity</strong> that we&#39;ve discussed elsewhere (and I&#39;ll put a link for that),<sup><a href="./9-the-subject-of-the-japanese-sentence-expressing-desire-ほしい-たい-たがる">[9]</a></sup> <strong>such as <code>欲しい</code>, which represents our desire for something, or <code>怖い</code> which represents our fear of something.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""></p><p>As usual, these adjectives are pointed at the thing that we desire, that we fear, etc. And <strong>in this case, they&#39;re pointed at the thing that we consider unlikely.</strong></p><p><strong>It represents really our subjectivity about the likelihood of something.</strong></p><h4 id="an-exact-japanese-equivalent-to-あるまい" tabindex="-1">An exact Japanese equivalent to あるまい <a class="header-anchor" href="#an-exact-japanese-equivalent-to-あるまい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;An exact Japanese equivalent to あるまい&quot;">​</a></h4><p>If we want to give an exact Japanese equivalent, <strong><code>あるまい</code> is directly equivalent to <code>ないだろう</code><br> (doesn&#39;t exist, I conjecture) or <code>ないでしょう</code></strong>, and <strong><code>ではあるまい</code></strong> is directly equivalent to <code>ではないだろう</code>, <code>ではないでしょう</code>, <code>じゃないだろう</code>, <code>じゃないでしょう</code>, <em>(to all of these forms)</em></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt=""></p><p>in other words, <strong><code>A isn&#39;t B, I would conjecture, it seems likely</code> etc.</strong></p><p>And <strong>the interesting point here is that</strong>, as we see, <strong>with this conjectural use of the volitional <strong>in its positive, more usual form</strong>, we don&#39;t attach the volitional directly to the verb that we&#39;re conjecturing about.</strong></p><p>So <strong>we don&#39;t say <code>さくらはすぐに帰ろう</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>That doesn&#39;t mean <code>Sakura will probably come</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>We say</strong> <code>さくらはすぐに<strong>来るでしょう</strong> (or だろう)</code>, because that&#39;s the way we do it. <strong>We do it with the volitional copula when we&#39;re making that kind of conjecture.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>But with <code>まい</code> we can attach it directly to the verb</strong> as we did in the previous example.</p><p><code>そんなことは<strong>あるまい</strong></code> is directly equivalent to <code>そんなことは<strong>ないでしょう</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>And there&#39;s no room for ambiguity here because <code>まい</code> has a more limited range of meanings,</strong> as we&#39;ve just discussed, <strong>than the positive volitional has</strong>, so we&#39;re not going to get confused with, say, a call to action, <strong>because <code>まい</code> doesn&#39;t do calls to inaction.</strong></p><p>So, <strong>the most common use of <code>まい</code> is as the negative adjectival of these <code>でしょう / だろう</code> conjectural constructions.</strong></p><h3 id="まい-used-for-a-strong-decision-or-determination-not-to-do-something" tabindex="-1">まい used for a strong decision or determination not to do something <a class="header-anchor" href="#まい-used-for-a-strong-decision-or-determination-not-to-do-something" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;まい used for a strong decision or determination not to do something&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>However, it is also used for one other negativizing structure that is directly equivalent to the positive.</strong></p><p>So we can say <code>二度と行くまい</code> (I won&#39;t go there again; literally, I won&#39;t go a second time). That&#39;s the other common meaning.</p><p><strong>When it&#39;s not expressing a likelihood or possibility, it&#39;s expressing a strong decision or determination not to do something.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, beyond these few uses, there are also a couple of other common constructions in which <code>まい</code> is used, and you&#39;re pretty much certain to hear these.</p><h3 id="using-positive-negative-volitional-together" tabindex="-1">Using positive &amp; negative volitional together <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-positive-negative-volitional-together" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using positive &amp; negative volitional together&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>One uses the positive and negative volitional forms together, meaning whether the verb is done or not.</strong></p><p>So, for example, <strong><code>行こうか, 行くまいか</code></strong> means <strong><code>whether I go or not</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>Now, <strong>this is very similar to a construction</strong> that we&#39;ve talked about before and that you probably know already<sup><a href="./39-the-か-particle-buried-questions-かな-もんか-かどうか">[39]</a></sup>, <strong><code>行くかどうか</code></strong> which means literally <strong><code>whether I go or how</code></strong>, which in more natural English would be <code>whether I go or what</code>.</p><h3 id="attaching-し-to-the-まい-construction" tabindex="-1">Attaching し to the まい construction <a class="header-anchor" href="#attaching-し-to-the-まい-construction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attaching し to the まい construction&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Now, the other construction that you&#39;ll commonly hear is formed by simply attaching <code>し</code>, which is used for listing causes of something,</strong> but as we&#39;ve discussed elsewhere<sup><a href="./63-wild-sentence-enders-in-real-life-japanese-かい-だい-ぜ-ぞ-さ-から-し-ちょうだい">[63]</a></sup>, <strong>it&#39;s often used on its own just to imply a continuing list.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>And <strong>this gives a construction that&#39;s somewhat comparable to the <code>it isn&#39;t as if...</code> or <code>it isn&#39;t like...</code> construction in English.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>金持ちでは<strong>あるまいし</strong></code> which is roughly equivalent to the saying <strong>in English</strong> <code>it&#39;s <strong>not as if</strong> we&#39;re rich</code>, or <code>世界が終わるわけが<strong>あるまいし</strong></code> (it&#39;s <strong>not as if</strong> the world is going to end).</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>In the video subs, it does not record the が after わけ, but Dolly seems to pronounce it, it is just very weakly pronounced by her here if you listen carefully.</p></div><p><strong>That&#39;s how we&#39;d put it in English.</strong></p><p><strong>In Japanese</strong>, it&#39;s more like saying <code>it isn&#39;t <strong>that</strong> we&#39;re rich <strong>or something like that</strong></code> <strong>(that&#39;s the <code>し</code> , the something like that).</strong> <em>(I am trying to highlight the parts, but it is limited, luckily the video picture above shows it well)</em></p><p><strong>And the volitional is again marking a negative hypothetical.</strong></p><p>Someone might act as if the world were going to end, <strong>but in fact it probably isn&#39;t.</strong> We might look to some people as if we&#39;re rich <strong>but, well, we don&#39;t seem to be, do we?</strong></p><p>So this is how the <code>まい</code> helper works in its various different common uses…</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This can be useful, even if unrelated here.Sorry if hard to read, zoom-in here or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4A9DK7Rtcw&amp;lc=UgxlL8--buf4g_Gld_l4AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>see here</strong></a><br><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p></div>',85)]))}const I=g(w,[["render",v]]);export{j as __pageData,I as default};
